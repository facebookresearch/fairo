# Facebook Robotics Platform

Deploy, launch, manage, and orchestrate heteronigious robots with ease!

## Install

Before installing, you'll need python3+pip and docker.

```sh
pip install .
docker build -t fbrp/base .
```

## Example

The example has three dummy processes, to show off different aspects of `fbrp_setup.py`.

* mycamera: A docker-based process.
* myimu: A conda-based process.
* myimageproc: A docker-based process, with a dependency on mycamera.

`cd` into the example and run one of:
```sh
# To bring up all the processes:
python fbrp_setup.py up
# To bring up the image processer and the camera dependency:
python fbrp_setup.py up myimageproc
# To bring up the image processer without any dependencies:
python fbrp_setup.py up myimageproc --nodeps
# To rebuild the process and run replace it within the running system:
python fbrp_setup.py up myimageproc -f --nodeps
```

All the processes default to running in the background. To see the stdout:
```sh
python fbrp_setup.py logs
```

To bring down one process in the running system:
```
python fbrp_setup.py down <process>
```

To bring down the whole system:
```
python fbrp_setup.py down
```

To debug a process in pdb:
```
python fbrp_setup.py pdb
```

## TODO:

* Consider non-docker container environments:
  * Singularity
  * Conda
* Remote execution.
* Extend api.
* Provide utility processes:
  * Logging
  * System monitoring
  * Configuration
  * ...
