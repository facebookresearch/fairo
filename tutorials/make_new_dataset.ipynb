    "# Datasets for Semantic Parsing Model\n",
    "The semantic parsing model converts plain text to a nested action dictionary that is partially executable. \n",
    "\n",
    "The training dataset for this was created meticulously using a crowdsourcing procedure we describe in detail here: https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.427.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "More details on the existing dataset used for training the semantic parsing model, here : https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/droidlet/blob/master/tutorials/semantic_parser_onboarding.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating your own dataset\n",
    "If you want to create your own dataset, the high level procedure to follow would be :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Come up with new natural language command examples.\n",
    "2. Get annotations for these commands.\n",
    "3. Create the training data in the format explained here: \n",
    "https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/droidlet/blob/master/tutorials/semantic_parser_onboarding.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting annotations for new examples\n",
    "\n",
    "We designed and open-sourced a multi-step web-based tool which asks users a series of multiple-choice questions to determine the semantic content of a sentence. The responses to some questions will prompt other more specific questions, in a process that mirrors the hierarchical structure of the grammar (described here: https://github.com/facebookresearch/droidlet/blob/main/base_agent/documents/Action_Dictionary_Spec.md) . \n",
    "\n",
    "These tools are available for use, here: https://github.com/facebookresearch/droidlet/tree/main/tools/annotation_tools/text_to_tree_tool .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Annotating  the data**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the new commands in your dataset are supported by our grammar (defined here: https://github.com/facebookresearch/droidlet/blob/main/base_agent/documents/Action_Dictionary_Spec.md), then you can directly use the tools above with Mechanical Turk to get final annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if there are commands in your dataset that don't fall under the category of actions (Build, Destroy, Dig, ...etc) or dialogue types (human_give_command, get_memory, put_memory) or are just new additions to what we released, then the existing tool and grammar will need to be extended. \n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed way to go about the extension and a general intuitive explanation about the annotation process is as follows :\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Example command: **\"touch the green chair\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. What kind of dialogue is it ? - Human is giving a command, so `\"dialogue_type\" : \"HUMAN_GIVE_COMMAND\"`\n",
    "  2. Given the dialogue type, other semantic details of the sentence:\n",
    "    - Are there multiple actions ? - Just one single action, so `\"action_sequence\"` list will have one dictionary in it.\n",
    "    - Is there a specific kind of action? Can any of the existing actions be reused ? - We need a new `\"action_type\" : \"TOUCH\"`\n",
    "    - What is it that needs to be touched? `\"reference_object\" : {\"text_span\" : \"the green chair\"}`\n",
    "      - More details about the thing (these go under the \"filters\"):\n",
    "        - `\"has_name\" : \"chair\"` , and `\"has_colour\": \"green\"`\n",
    "    - Does the action need to be repeated ? No.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Based on above, the full dictionary looks like:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  { \"dialogue_type\": \"HUMAN_GIVE_COMMAND\",\n",
    "    \"action_sequence\" : [\n",

    "          }\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    }]\n",
    "  }\n",

    "    - What is it that needs to be dug? `\"schematic\" : {\"text_span\" : \"three tiny holes\"}`\n",
    "      - More details about the thing that needs to be dug:\n",
    "        - `\"has_name\" : \"holes\"` , and `\"has_size\": \"tiny\"`\n",
    "    - Is there a location where the hole will be dug ? - Yes:\n",
    "      - More details about the location:\n",
    "        - The location is represented using indefinite noun, so `\"location\" : {\"contains_coreference\" : \"yes\"}`\n",
