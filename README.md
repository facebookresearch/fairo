**Fairo** (pronounced _"pharaoh"_) is a unified robotics platform developed by researchers at [Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com/). It currently comprises of a set of projects:

- [Droidlet](./droidlet) is an **_early research project for AI researchers_** to explore ideas around grounded dialogue, interactive learning and human-computer interfaces. It helps you rapidly build agents (real or virtual) that perform a wide variety of tasks specified by humans. The agents can use natural language, memory and humans in the loop.
- [Polymetis](./polymetis) is a PyTorch-based real-time controller manager. It lets you write PyTorch controllers for robots, test them in simulation, and seamlessly transfer to real-time hardware.
- [Meta Robotics Platform](./mrp) lets you deploy, launch, manage, and orchestrate heterogeneous robots with ease.
