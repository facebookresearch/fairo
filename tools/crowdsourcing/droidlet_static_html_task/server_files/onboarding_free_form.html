            <p><b>Imagine you are playing a creative game in a 3-D voxel world and you have access to an assistant (as shown in some screenshots above) that can help you get things done.</b><br />
            <b>Use your imagination and creativity to interact with the assistant. In the setup here, you will be logged in to the voxel world along with the assistant.</b><br />
            </p>

            <b>Keep in mind that the robot assistant is non-violent. </b></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            
            <b>You can assume that the robot has the following capabilities:</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Move</b> (the bot can be told to move around to places, objects, things etc)</li>
                <li><b>Build</b> (the bot can be told to build things)</li>
                <li><b>Destroy</b> (the bot can be told to destroy things)</li>
                <li><b>Dance</b> (the bot can be told to do a movement of some kind)</li>
                <li><b>Get</b> (the bot can be told to get things from one place to another)</li>
                <li><b>Tag</b> (the bot can be told to tag things)</li>
                <li><b>Dig</b> (the bot can be told to dig up things)</li>
                <li><b>Copy</b> (the bot can be told to make a copy of things)</li>
                <li><b>Undo</b> (the bot can be told to revert things)</li>
                <li><b>Fill</b> (the bot can be told to fill up structures)</li>
                <li><b>Spawn</b> (the bot can be told to spawn objects)</li>
                <li><b>Answer</b> (the bot can be told to answer your questions)</li>
                <li><b>Stop</b> (the bot can be told to stop)</li>
                <li><b>Resume</b> (the bot can be told to resume an earlier action)</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p><b>You can talk to the bot as you would to another human player to instruct it to perform actions mentioned above, ask it questions, or to give it information.</b></p><br />
