# Blockly Template Tool

The goal of this tool is to enable users to efficiently create templates for the CraftAssist bot. A [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly) interface is used. This project is in active development.

# Installation

Open a terminal in the `template_tool` folder and do

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

This will spawn a `localhost` window.

Open another terminal in the `template_tool` folder and do

```
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

If either installation fails, do ` npm rebuild`.

The backend is serving the app on `localhost:9000` and the frontend on `localhost:3000` (by default). The frontend may be run on another port, but the backend must remain to be at `localhost:9000`.
