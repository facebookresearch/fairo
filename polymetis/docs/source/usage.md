# Usage

## Running the server and robot client (simulation)

### Run both server & client **on your machine**:

To run the server and robot client for Franka:
```bash
launch_robot.py robot_client=franka_sim use_real_time=false gui=[true|false]
```

`launch_robot.py` is an executable script which starts both a controller manager server and a robot client which connects to it, and is installed as a script with the conda package by default in `$CONDA_PREFIX/bin`. It utilizes [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) configurations to easily swap between simulation and hardware.

For simulation, the `gui` option controls whether the PyBullet simulation renders, and requires an active display (i.e. you may need to use VNC if `ssh`ing).

## Running the server and robot client on Franka Panda hardware

### Run the server **on the NUC**:

1. Wait for your robot to boot up (wait for the blinking yellow light turns solid yellow).
1. If your robot has its joints locked (yellow light), unlock it from Franka Desk.
1. If your robot's external activation device (EAD) is not released (white light), release it (blue light). (If you disconnect from the robot for any reason, you need to re-release the EAD.)

Then:

```bash
# On the NUC
launch_robot.py robot_client=franka_hardware
```

For hardware, `use_real_time` acquires the necessary `sudo` rights for real-time optimizations (see [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairo/blob/main/polymetis/polymetis/include/real_time.hpp) for the specific optimizations.)


For debugging and calibration purposes, we provide a read-only mode for the robot client, where no torques will be applied to the robot but robot states are still recorded normally. To launch the robot client in read-only mode:
```bash
# On the NUC
launch_robot.py robot_client=franka_hardware robot_client.executable_cfg.readonly=true
```

### Running user-code controllers **on your machine**:

Once you start an instance of `launch_robot.py`, you can send commands by utilizing the example user code, found in [scripts](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairo/tree/main/polymetis/examples).

For real-time uses (e.g. on hardware), it is highly recommended that this is run on a different machine than the machine directly controlling the robot, to avoid interruptions of the real-time loop. To do this, simply edit the `ip` while constructing the `RobotInterface`, e.g. in the [scripts](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairo/tree/main/polymetis/examples).

To **debug custom TorchScript policies**, TorchScript can directly script `print` statements, which will output **on the server** (i.e. for hardware, it will print on the NUC machine, where the `launch_robot.py` script was launched).


## Running the gripper **on your machine**

We currently support two grippers: Franka Hand and Robotiq 2F Gripper.

To run the gripper server:
```bash
launch_gripper.py gripper=<franka_hand|robotiq_2f>
```

`launch_gripper.py` launches a service that exposes gripper functionality to a connected `GripperInterface`. 

You can modify the configuration on the command line through Hydra. For example, to change the comport (communication port) while using the [Robotiq 2F gripper config](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairo/blob/main/polymetis/polymetis/conf/gripper/robotiq_2f.yaml):

```bash
launch_gripper.py gripper=robotiq_2f gripper.comport=/dev/ttyUSB1
```

## Using the Allegro Hand Client

The Allegro Hand client communicates using the SocketCAN interface which is included with modern Linux kernels.
Before starting the Allegro Hand client you must configure your CAN netdev interface and specify the CAN bus network interface name in the `allegro_hardware.yaml` configuration file.

One way to configure the CAN netdev interface is:
```bash
sudo ip link set can0 type can bitrate 1000000
sudo ip link set can0 up
```

you can use the command:
```bash
ip link ls 
```
to check the names of the available CAN interfaces in your system.

To launch the Allegro Hand client run the command:
```bash
launch_robot.py robot_client=allegro_hardware robot_model=allegro_hand
```

*Note:* if you previously installed the PEAK pcan kernel modules for libpcanbasic, the SocketCAN drivers have likely been blocklisted.  On Ubuntu systems you can undo this by commenting out all lines in the file `/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-peak.conf `
