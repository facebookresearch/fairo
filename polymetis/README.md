> **Polymetis**: adj., Ancient Greek. _Clever in many ways._ Applied to Odysseus by Homer in the _Odyssey_.

**Write [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) controllers for robots, test them in simulation, and seamlessly transfer to real-time hardware.**

**Polymetis** powers robotics research at [Facebook AI Research](https://ai.facebook.com/). If you want to write your robot policies in PyTorch for simulation and immediately transfer them to high-frequency (1kHz) policies on real-time hardware (e.g. Franka Panda), read on!

## Features

- **Unified simulation & hardware interface**: Write all your robot controllers just once -- immediately transfer them to real-time hardware. You can even train neural network policies using reinforcement learning in simulation and transfer them to hardware, with just a single configuration toggle.
- **Write your own robot controllers:** Use the building blocks in our [TorchControl](https://facebookresearch.github.io/fairo/polymetis/torchcontrol-doc.html) library to write complex robot controllers, including operational space control. Take advantage of our wrapping of the [Pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio) dynamics library for your robot dynamics.
- **Drop-in replacement for [PyRobot](https://pyrobot.org/)**: If you're already using PyRobot, you can use the exact same interface, but immediately gain access to arbitrary, custom high-frequency robot controllers.

## Get started

To get started, you only need one line:

```
conda install -c pytorch -c fair-robotics -c aihabitat -c conda-forge polymetis
```

You can immediately start running the [example scripts](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairo/tree/main/polymetis/examples) in both simulation and hardware. See [installation](https://facebookresearch.github.io/fairo/polymetis/installation.html) and [usage](https://facebookresearch.github.io/fairo/polymetis/usage.html) documentation for details.

## Documentation

All documentation on the [website](https://facebookresearch.github.io/fairo/polymetis/). Includes:

- Guides on setting up your [Franka Panda](https://frankaemika.github.io/docs/libfranka.html) hardware for real-time control
- How to quickly get started in [PyBullet](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet30) simulation
- Writing developing your own custom controllers in PyTorch
- Full [autogenerated documentation](https://facebookresearch.github.io/fairo/polymetis/modules.html)

## Benchmarking

To run benchmarking, first configure the [script](polymetis/tests/python/polymetis/benchmarks/benchmark_robustness.py) to point to your hardware instance, then run

```bash
asv run --python=python --set-commit-hash $(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

To update the dashboard, run:

```bash
asv publish
```

Commit the result under `.asv/results` and `docs/`; it will show up under the benchmarking page in the documentation.
