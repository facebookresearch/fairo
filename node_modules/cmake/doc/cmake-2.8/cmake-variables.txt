Introduction

cmake-variables - Reference of CMake variables.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Variables that Provide Information

variables defined by cmake, that give information about the project, and
cmake

  CMAKE_AR
       Name of archiving tool for static libraries.

       This specifies name of the program that creates archive or static
       libraries.

  CMAKE_ARGC
       Number of command line arguments passed to CMake in script mode.

       When run in -P script mode, CMake sets this variable to the number of
       command line arguments.  See also CMAKE_ARGV0, 1, 2 ...

  CMAKE_ARGV0
       Command line argument passed to CMake in script mode.

       When run in -P script mode, CMake sets this variable to the first
       command line argument.  It then also sets CMAKE_ARGV1, CMAKE_ARGV2,
       ...  and so on, up to the number of command line arguments given.  See
       also CMAKE_ARGC.

  CMAKE_BINARY_DIR
       The path to the top level of the build tree.

       This is the full path to the top level of the current CMake build
       tree.  For an in-source build, this would be the same as
       CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR.

  CMAKE_BUILD_TOOL
       Tool used for the actual build process.

       This variable is set to the program that will be needed to build the
       output of CMake.  If the generator selected was Visual Studio 6, the
       CMAKE_BUILD_TOOL will be set to msdev, for Unix makefiles it will be
       set to make or gmake, and for Visual Studio 7 it set to devenv.  For
       Nmake Makefiles the value is nmake.  This can be useful for adding
       special flags and commands based on the final build environment.

  CMAKE_CACHEFILE_DIR
       The directory with the CMakeCache.txt file.

       This is the full path to the directory that has the CMakeCache.txt
       file in it.  This is the same as CMAKE_BINARY_DIR.

  CMAKE_CACHE_MAJOR_VERSION
       Major version of CMake used to create the CMakeCache.txt file

       This is stores the major version of CMake used to write a CMake cache
       file.  It is only different when a different version of CMake is run
       on a previously created cache file.

  CMAKE_CACHE_MINOR_VERSION
       Minor version of CMake used to create the CMakeCache.txt file

       This is stores the minor version of CMake used to write a CMake cache
       file.  It is only different when a different version of CMake is run
       on a previously created cache file.

  CMAKE_CACHE_PATCH_VERSION
       Patch version of CMake used to create the CMakeCache.txt file

       This is stores the patch version of CMake used to write a CMake cache
       file.  It is only different when a different version of CMake is run
       on a previously created cache file.

  CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR
       Build-time reference to per-configuration output subdirectory.

       For native build systems supporting multiple configurations in the
       build tree (such as Visual Studio and Xcode), the value is a reference
       to a build-time variable specifying the name of the per-configuration
       output subdirectory.  On Makefile generators this evaluates to "."
       because there is only one configuration in a build tree.  Example
       values:

         $(IntDir)        = Visual Studio 6
         $(OutDir)        = Visual Studio 7, 8, 9
         $(Configuration) = Visual Studio 10
         $(CONFIGURATION) = Xcode
         .                = Make-based tools

       Since these values are evaluated by the native build system, this
       variable is suitable only for use in command lines that will be
       evaluated at build time.  Example of intended usage:

         add_executable(mytool mytool.c)
         add_custom_command(
           OUTPUT out.txt
           COMMAND ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool
                   ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/in.txt out.txt
           DEPENDS mytool in.txt
           )
         add_custom_target(drive ALL DEPENDS out.txt)

       Note that CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR is no longer necessary for this purpose but
       has been left for compatibility with existing projects.  Instead
       add_custom_command() recognizes executable target names in its COMMAND
       option, so "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool"
       can be replaced by just "mytool".

       This variable is read-only.  Setting it is undefined behavior.  In
       multi-configuration build systems the value of this variable is passed
       as the value of preprocessor symbol "CMAKE_INTDIR" to the compilation
       of all source files.

  CMAKE_COMMAND
       The full path to the cmake executable.

       This is the full path to the CMake executable cmake which is useful
       from custom commands that want to use the cmake -E option for portable
       system commands.  (e.g.  /usr/local/bin/cmake

  CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING
       Is CMake currently cross compiling.

       This variable will be set to true by CMake if CMake is cross
       compiling.  Specifically if the build platform is different from the
       target platform.

  CMAKE_CTEST_COMMAND
       Full path to ctest command installed with cmake.

       This is the full path to the CTest executable ctest which is useful
       from custom commands that want to use the cmake -E option for portable
       system commands.

  CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR
       The path to the binary directory currently being processed.

       This the full path to the build directory that is currently being
       processed by cmake.  Each directory added by add_subdirectory will
       create a binary directory in the build tree, and as it is being
       processed this variable will be set.  For in-source builds this is the
       current source directory being processed.

  CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR
       Full directory of the listfile currently being processed.

       As CMake processes the listfiles in your project this variable will
       always be set to the directory where the listfile which is currently
       being processed (CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE) is located.  The value has
       dynamic scope.  When CMake starts processing commands in a source file
       it sets this variable to the directory where this file is located.
       When CMake finishes processing commands from the file it restores the
       previous value.  Therefore the value of the variable inside a macro or
       function is the directory of the file invoking the bottom-most entry
       on the call stack, not the directory of the file containing the macro
       or function definition.

       See also CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE.

  CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE
       Full path to the listfile currently being processed.

       As CMake processes the listfiles in your project this variable will
       always be set to the one currently being processed.  The value has
       dynamic scope.  When CMake starts processing commands in a source file
       it sets this variable to the location of the file.  When CMake
       finishes processing commands from the file it restores the previous
       value.  Therefore the value of the variable inside a macro or function
       is the file invoking the bottom-most entry on the call stack, not the
       file containing the macro or function definition.

       See also CMAKE_PARENT_LIST_FILE.

  CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_LINE
       The line number of the current file being processed.

       This is the line number of the file currently being processed by
       cmake.

  CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR
       The path to the source directory currently being processed.

       This the full path to the source directory that is currently being
       processed by cmake.

  CMAKE_DL_LIBS
       Name of library containing dlopen and dlcose.

       The name of the library that has dlopen and dlclose in it, usually
       -ldl on most UNIX machines.

  CMAKE_EDIT_COMMAND
       Full path to cmake-gui or ccmake.

       This is the full path to the CMake executable that can graphically
       edit the cache.  For example, cmake-gui, ccmake, or cmake -i.

  CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX
       The suffix for executables on this platform.

       The suffix to use for the end of an executable if any, .exe on
       Windows.

       CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX_<LANG> overrides this for language <LANG>.

  CMAKE_EXTRA_GENERATOR
       The extra generator used to build the project.

       When using the Eclipse, CodeBlocks or KDevelop generators, CMake
       generates Makefiles (CMAKE_GENERATOR) and additionally project files
       for the respective IDE.  This IDE project file generator is stored in
       CMAKE_EXTRA_GENERATOR (e.g.  "Eclipse CDT4").

  CMAKE_EXTRA_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES
       Additional suffixes for shared libraries.

       Extensions for shared libraries other than that specified by
       CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX, if any.  CMake uses this to recognize
       external shared library files during analysis of libraries linked by a
       target.

  CMAKE_GENERATOR
       The generator used to build the project.

       The name of the generator that is being used to generate the build
       files.  (e.g.  "Unix Makefiles", "Visual Studio 6", etc.)

  CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET
       Native build system toolset name specified by user.

       Some CMake generators support a toolset name to be given to the native
       build system to choose a compiler.  If the user specifies a toolset
       name (e.g.  via the cmake -T option) the value will be available in
       this variable.

  CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY
       Path to top of source tree.

       This is the path to the top level of the source tree.

  CMAKE_IMPORT_LIBRARY_PREFIX
       The prefix for import libraries that you link to.

       The prefix to use for the name of an import library if used on this
       platform.

       CMAKE_IMPORT_LIBRARY_PREFIX_<LANG> overrides this for language <LANG>.

  CMAKE_IMPORT_LIBRARY_SUFFIX
       The suffix for import libraries that you link to.

       The suffix to use for the end of an import library if used on this
       platform.

       CMAKE_IMPORT_LIBRARY_SUFFIX_<LANG> overrides this for language <LANG>.

  CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_SUFFIX
       The suffix for libraries that you link to.

       The suffix to use for the end of a library, .lib on Windows.

  CMAKE_MAJOR_VERSION
       The Major version of cmake (i.e.  the 2 in 2.X.X)

       This specifies the major version of the CMake executable being run.

  CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM
       See CMAKE_BUILD_TOOL.

       This variable is around for backwards compatibility, see
       CMAKE_BUILD_TOOL.

  CMAKE_MINOR_VERSION
       The Minor version of cmake (i.e.  the 4 in X.4.X).

       This specifies the minor version of the CMake executable being run.

  CMAKE_PARENT_LIST_FILE
       Full path to the parent listfile of the one currently being processed.

       As CMake processes the listfiles in your project this variable will
       always be set to the listfile that included or somehow invoked the one
       currently being processed.  See also CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE.

  CMAKE_PATCH_VERSION
       The patch version of cmake (i.e.  the 3 in X.X.3).

       This specifies the patch version of the CMake executable being run.

  CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME
       The name of the current project.

       This specifies name of the current project from the closest inherited
       PROJECT command.

  CMAKE_RANLIB
       Name of randomizing tool for static libraries.

       This specifies name of the program that randomizes libraries on UNIX,
       not used on Windows, but may be present.

  CMAKE_ROOT
       Install directory for running cmake.

       This is the install root for the running CMake and the Modules
       directory can be found here.  This is commonly used in this format:
       ${CMAKE_ROOT}/Modules

  CMAKE_SCRIPT_MODE_FILE
       Full path to the -P script file currently being processed.

       When run in -P script mode, CMake sets this variable to the full path
       of the script file.  When run to configure a CMakeLists.txt file, this
       variable is not set.

  CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_PREFIX
       The prefix for shared libraries that you link to.

       The prefix to use for the name of a shared library, lib on UNIX.

       CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_PREFIX_<LANG> overrides this for language <LANG>.

  CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX
       The suffix for shared libraries that you link to.

       The suffix to use for the end of a shared library, .dll on Windows.

       CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX_<LANG> overrides this for language <LANG>.

  CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_PREFIX
       The prefix for loadable modules that you link to.

       The prefix to use for the name of a loadable module on this platform.

       CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_PREFIX_<LANG> overrides this for language <LANG>.

  CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_SUFFIX
       The suffix for shared libraries that you link to.

       The suffix to use for the end of a loadable module on this platform

       CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_SUFFIX_<LANG> overrides this for language <LANG>.

  CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P
       Size of a void pointer.

       This is set to the size of a pointer on the machine, and is determined
       by a try compile.  If a 64 bit size is found, then the library search
       path is modified to look for 64 bit libraries first.

  CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH
       If true, do not add run time path information.

       If this is set to TRUE, then the rpath information is not added to
       compiled executables.  The default is to add rpath information if the
       platform supports it.  This allows for easy running from the build
       tree.  To omit RPATH in the install step, but not the build step, use
       CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH instead.

  CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR
       The path to the top level of the source tree.

       This is the full path to the top level of the current CMake source
       tree.  For an in-source build, this would be the same as
       CMAKE_BINARY_DIR.

  CMAKE_STANDARD_LIBRARIES
       Libraries linked into every executable and shared library.

       This is the list of libraries that are linked into all executables and
       libraries.

  CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_PREFIX
       The prefix for static libraries that you link to.

       The prefix to use for the name of a static library, lib on UNIX.

       CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_PREFIX_<LANG> overrides this for language <LANG>.

  CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_SUFFIX
       The suffix for static libraries that you link to.

       The suffix to use for the end of a static library, .lib on Windows.

       CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_SUFFIX_<LANG> overrides this for language <LANG>.

  CMAKE_TWEAK_VERSION
       The tweak version of cmake (i.e.  the 1 in X.X.X.1).

       This specifies the tweak version of the CMake executable being run.
       Releases use tweak < 20000000 and development versions use the date
       format CCYYMMDD for the tweak level.

  CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE
       Create verbose makefiles if on.

       This variable defaults to false.  You can set this variable to true to
       make CMake produce verbose makefiles that show each command line as it
       is used.

  CMAKE_VERSION
       The full version of cmake in major.minor.patch[.tweak[-id]] format.

       This specifies the full version of the CMake executable being run.
       This variable is defined by versions 2.6.3 and higher.  See variables
       CMAKE_MAJOR_VERSION, CMAKE_MINOR_VERSION, CMAKE_PATCH_VERSION, and
       CMAKE_TWEAK_VERSION for individual version components.  The [-id]
       component appears in non-release versions and may be arbitrary text.

  CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET
       Visual Studio Platform Toolset name.

       VS 10 and above use MSBuild under the hood and support multiple
       compiler toolchains.  CMake may specify a toolset explicitly, such as
       "v110" for VS 11 or "Windows7.1SDK" for 64-bit support in VS 10
       Express.  CMake provides the name of the chosen toolset in this
       variable.

  CMAKE_XCODE_PLATFORM_TOOLSET
       Xcode compiler selection.

       Xcode supports selection of a compiler from one of the installed
       toolsets.  CMake provides the name of the chosen toolset in this
       variable, if any is explicitly selected (e.g.  via the cmake -T
       option).

  PROJECT_BINARY_DIR
       Full path to build directory for project.

       This is the binary directory of the most recent PROJECT command.

  PROJECT_NAME
       Name of the project given to the project command.

       This is the name given to the most recent PROJECT command.

  PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR
       Top level source directory for the current project.

       This is the source directory of the most recent PROJECT command.

  [Project name]_BINARY_DIR
       Top level binary directory for the named project.

       A variable is created with the name used in the PROJECT command, and
       is the binary directory for the project.  This can be useful when
       SUBDIR is used to connect several projects.

  [Project name]_SOURCE_DIR
       Top level source directory for the named project.

       A variable is created with the name used in the PROJECT command, and
       is the source directory for the project.  This can be useful when
       add_subdirectory is used to connect several projects.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Variables That Change Behavior

  BUILD_SHARED_LIBS
       Global flag to cause add_library to create shared libraries if on.

       If present and true, this will cause all libraries to be built shared
       unless the library was explicitly added as a static library.  This
       variable is often added to projects as an OPTION so that each user of
       a project can decide if they want to build the project using shared or
       static libraries.

  CMAKE_ABSOLUTE_DESTINATION_FILES
       List of files which have been installed using an ABSOLUTE DESTINATION
       path.

       This variable is defined by CMake-generated cmake_install.cmake
       scripts.  It can be used (read-only) by program or script that source
       those install scripts.  This is used by some CPack generators (e.g.
       RPM).

  CMAKE_AUTOMOC_RELAXED_MODE
       Switch between strict and relaxed automoc mode.

       By default, automoc behaves exactly as described in the documentation
       of the AUTOMOC target property.  When set to TRUE, it accepts more
       input and tries to find the correct input file for moc even if it
       differs from the documented behaviour.  In this mode it e.g.  also
       checks whether a header file is intended to be processed by moc when a
       "foo.moc" file has been included.

       Relaxed mode has to be enabled for KDE4 compatibility.

  CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY
       Version of cmake required to build project

       From the point of view of backwards compatibility, this specifies what
       version of CMake should be supported.  By default this value is the
       version number of CMake that you are running.  You can set this to an
       older version of CMake to support deprecated commands of CMake in
       projects that were written to use older versions of CMake.  This can
       be set by the user or set at the beginning of a CMakeLists file.

  CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
       Specifies the build type for make based generators.

       This specifies what build type will be built in this tree.  Possible
       values are empty, Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo and MinSizeRel.  This
       variable is only supported for make based generators.  If this
       variable is supported, then CMake will also provide initial values for
       the variables with the name
       CMAKE_C_FLAGS_[DEBUG|RELEASE|RELWITHDEBINFO|MINSIZEREL].  For example,
       if CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is Debug, then CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG will be added
       to the CMAKE_C_FLAGS.

  CMAKE_COLOR_MAKEFILE
       Enables color output when using the Makefile generator.

       When enabled, the generated Makefiles will produce colored output.
       Default is ON.

  CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES
       Specifies the available build types.

       This specifies what build types will be available such as Debug,
       Release, RelWithDebInfo etc.  This has reasonable defaults on most
       platforms.  But can be extended to provide other build types.  See
       also CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.

  CMAKE_DEBUG_TARGET_PROPERTIES
       Enables tracing output for target properties.

       This variable can be populated with a list of properties to generate
       debug output for when evaluating target properties.  Currently it can
       only be used when evaluating the INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES target property.
       In that case, it outputs a backtrace for each include directory in the
       build.  Default is unset.

  CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_<PackageName>
       Variable for disabling find_package() calls.

       Every non-REQUIRED find_package() call in a project can be disabled by
       setting the variable CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_<PackageName> to TRUE.
       This can be used to build a project without an optional package,
       although that package is installed.

       This switch should be used during the initial CMake run.  Otherwise if
       the package has already been found in a previous CMake run, the
       variables which have been stored in the cache will still be there.  In
       the case it is recommended to remove the cache variables for this
       package from the cache using the cache editor or cmake -U

  CMAKE_ERROR_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION
       Ask cmake_install.cmake script to error out as soon as a file with
       absolute INSTALL DESTINATION is encountered.

       The fatal error is emitted before the installation of the offending
       file takes place.  This variable is used by CMake-generated
       cmake_install.cmake scripts.  If ones set this variable to ON while
       running the script, it may get fatal error messages from the script.

  CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_PREFIXES
       Prefixes to prepend when looking for libraries.

       This specifies what prefixes to add to library names when the
       find_library command looks for libraries.  On UNIX systems this is
       typically lib, meaning that when trying to find the foo library it
       will look for libfoo.

  CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES
       Suffixes to append when looking for libraries.

       This specifies what suffixes to add to library names when the
       find_library command looks for libraries.  On Windows systems this is
       typically .lib and .dll, meaning that when trying to find the foo
       library it will look for foo.dll etc.

  CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_WARN_NO_MODULE
       Tell find_package to warn if called without an explicit mode.

       If find_package is called without an explicit mode option (MODULE,
       CONFIG or NO_MODULE) and no Find<pkg>.cmake module is in
       CMAKE_MODULE_PATH then CMake implicitly assumes that the caller
       intends to search for a package configuration file.  If no package
       configuration file is found then the wording of the failure message
       must account for both the case that the package is really missing and
       the case that the project has a bug and failed to provide the intended
       Find module.  If instead the caller specifies an explicit mode option
       then the failure message can be more specific.

       Set CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_WARN_NO_MODULE to TRUE to tell find_package to
       warn when it implicitly assumes Config mode.  This helps developers
       enforce use of an explicit mode in all calls to find_package within a
       project.

  CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH
       Path to be ignored by FIND_XXX() commands.

       Specifies directories to be ignored by searches in FIND_XXX()
       commands.  This is useful in cross-compiled environments where some
       system directories contain incompatible but possibly linkable
       libraries.  For example, on cross-compiled cluster environments, this
       allows a user to ignore directories containing libraries meant for the
       front-end machine that modules like FindX11 (and others) would
       normally search.  By default this is empty; it is intended to be set
       by the project.  Note that CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH takes a list of directory
       names, NOT a list of prefixes.  If you want to ignore paths under
       prefixes (bin, include, lib, etc.), you'll need to specify them
       explicitly.  See also CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH,
       CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH.

  CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
       Path used for searching by FIND_FILE() and FIND_PATH().

       Specifies a path which will be used both by FIND_FILE() and
       FIND_PATH().  Both commands will check each of the contained
       directories for the existence of the file which is currently searched.
       By default it is empty, it is intended to be set by the project.  See
       also CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.

  CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_COMPONENT_NAME
       Default component used in install() commands.

       If an install() command is used without the COMPONENT argument, these
       files will be grouped into a default component.  The name of this
       default install component will be taken from this variable.  It
       defaults to "Unspecified".

  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
       Install directory used by install.

       If "make install" is invoked or INSTALL is built, this directory is
       pre-pended onto all install directories.  This variable defaults to
       /usr/local on UNIX and c:/Program Files on Windows.

       On UNIX one can use the DESTDIR mechanism in order to relocate the
       whole installation.  DESTDIR means DESTination DIRectory.  It is
       commonly used by makefile users in order to install software at
       non-default location.  It is usually invoked like this:

        make DESTDIR=/home/john install

       which will install the concerned software using the installation
       prefix, e.g.  "/usr/local" pre-pended with the DESTDIR value which
       finally gives "/home/john/usr/local".

       WARNING: DESTDIR may not be used on Windows because installation
       prefix usually contains a drive letter like in "C:/Program Files"
       which cannot be pre-pended with some other prefix.

  CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
       Path used for searching by FIND_LIBRARY().

       Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_LIBRARY().  FIND_LIBRARY()
       will check each of the contained directories for the existence of the
       library which is currently searched.  By default it is empty, it is
       intended to be set by the project.  See also
       CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH, CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.

  CMAKE_MFC_FLAG
       Tell cmake to use MFC for an executable or dll.

       This can be set in a CMakeLists.txt file and will enable MFC in the
       application.  It should be set to 1 for the static MFC library, and 2
       for the shared MFC library.  This is used in Visual Studio 6 and 7
       project files.  The CMakeSetup dialog used MFC and the CMakeLists.txt
       looks like this:

         add_definitions(-D_AFXDLL)
         set(CMAKE_MFC_FLAG 2)
         add_executable(CMakeSetup WIN32 ${SRCS})


  CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
       List of directories to search for CMake modules.

       Commands like include() and find_package() search for files in
       directories listed by this variable before checking the default
       modules that come with CMake.

  CMAKE_NOT_USING_CONFIG_FLAGS
       Skip _BUILD_TYPE flags if true.

       This is an internal flag used by the generators in CMake to tell CMake
       to skip the _BUILD_TYPE flags.

  CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP<NNNN>
       Default for CMake Policy CMP<NNNN> when it is otherwise left unset.

       Commands cmake_minimum_required(VERSION) and cmake_policy(VERSION) by
       default leave policies introduced after the given version unset.  Set
       CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP<NNNN> to OLD or NEW to specify the default
       for policy CMP<NNNN>, where <NNNN> is the policy number.

       This variable should not be set by a project in CMake code; use
       cmake_policy(SET) instead.  Users running CMake may set this variable
       in the cache (e.g.  -DCMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP<NNNN>=<OLD|NEW>) to set
       a policy not otherwise set by the project.  Set to OLD to quiet a
       policy warning while using old behavior or to NEW to try building the
       project with new behavior.

  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
       Path used for searching by FIND_XXX(), with appropriate suffixes
       added.

       Specifies a path which will be used by the FIND_XXX() commands.  It
       contains the "base" directories, the FIND_XXX() commands append
       appropriate subdirectories to the base directories.  So FIND_PROGRAM()
       adds /bin to each of the directories in the path, FIND_LIBRARY()
       appends /lib to each of the directories, and FIND_PATH() and
       FIND_FILE() append /include .  By default it is empty, it is intended
       to be set by the project.  See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH,
       CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH, CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH.

  CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH
       Path used for searching by FIND_PROGRAM().

       Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_PROGRAM().  FIND_PROGRAM()
       will check each of the contained directories for the existence of the
       program which is currently searched.  By default it is empty, it is
       intended to be set by the project.  See also
       CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH, CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.

  CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY
       Don't make the install target depend on the all target.

       By default, the "install" target depends on the "all" target.  This
       has the effect, that when "make install" is invoked or INSTALL is
       built, first the "all" target is built, then the installation starts.
       If CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY is set to TRUE, this dependency
       is not created, so the installation process will start immediately,
       independent from whether the project has been completely built or not.

  CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH
       Path to be ignored by FIND_XXX() commands.

       Specifies directories to be ignored by searches in FIND_XXX()
       commands.  This is useful in cross-compiled environments where some
       system directories contain incompatible but possibly linkable
       libraries.  For example, on cross-compiled cluster environments, this
       allows a user to ignore directories containing libraries meant for the
       front-end machine that modules like FindX11 (and others) would
       normally search.  By default this contains a list of directories
       containing incompatible binaries for the host system.  See also
       CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH, CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH,
       CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH, and CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH.

  CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
       Path used for searching by FIND_FILE() and FIND_PATH().

       Specifies a path which will be used both by FIND_FILE() and
       FIND_PATH().  Both commands will check each of the contained
       directories for the existence of the file which is currently searched.
       By default it contains the standard directories for the current
       system.  It is NOT intended to be modified by the project, use
       CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH for this.  See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.

  CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH
       Path used for searching by FIND_LIBRARY().

       Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_LIBRARY().  FIND_LIBRARY()
       will check each of the contained directories for the existence of the
       library which is currently searched.  By default it contains the
       standard directories for the current system.  It is NOT intended to be
       modified by the project, use CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH for this.  See also
       CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.

  CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
       Path used for searching by FIND_XXX(), with appropriate suffixes
       added.

       Specifies a path which will be used by the FIND_XXX() commands.  It
       contains the "base" directories, the FIND_XXX() commands append
       appropriate subdirectories to the base directories.  So FIND_PROGRAM()
       adds /bin to each of the directories in the path, FIND_LIBRARY()
       appends /lib to each of the directories, and FIND_PATH() and
       FIND_FILE() append /include .  By default this contains the standard
       directories for the current system.  It is NOT intended to be modified
       by the project, use CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH for this.  See also
       CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH,
       CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH, and CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH.

  CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH
       Path used for searching by FIND_PROGRAM().

       Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_PROGRAM().  FIND_PROGRAM()
       will check each of the contained directories for the existence of the
       program which is currently searched.  By default it contains the
       standard directories for the current system.  It is NOT intended to be
       modified by the project, use CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH for this.  See also
       CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.

  CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE
       Specify a CMake file that overrides platform information.

       CMake loads the specified file while enabling support for each
       language from either the project() or enable_language() commands.  It
       is loaded after CMake's builtin compiler and platform information
       modules have been loaded but before the information is used.  The file
       may set platform information variables to override CMake's defaults.

       This feature is intended for use only in overriding information
       variables that must be set before CMake builds its first test project
       to check that the compiler for a language works.  It should not be
       used to load a file in cases that a normal include() will work.  Use
       it only as a last resort for behavior that cannot be achieved any
       other way.  For example, one may set CMAKE_C_FLAGS_INIT to change the
       default value used to initialize CMAKE_C_FLAGS before it is cached.
       The override file should NOT be used to set anything that could be set
       after languages are enabled, such as variables like
       CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY that affect the placement of binaries.
       Information set in the file will be used for try_compile and try_run
       builds too.

  CMAKE_WARN_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION
       Ask cmake_install.cmake script to warn each time a file with absolute
       INSTALL DESTINATION is encountered.

       This variable is used by CMake-generated cmake_install.cmake scripts.
       If ones set this variable to ON while running the script, it may get
       warning messages from the script.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Variables That Describe the System

  APPLE
       True if running on Mac OSX.

       Set to true on Mac OSX.

       Using the 64 bit compiler from Microsoft

       Set to true when using the 64 bit cl compiler from Microsoft.

  CMAKE_COMPILER_2005
       Using the Visual Studio 2005 compiler from Microsoft

       Set to true when using the Visual Studio 2005 compiler from Microsoft.

  CMAKE_HOST_APPLE
       True for Apple OSXoperating systems.

       Set to true when the host system is Apple OSX.

  CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM
       Name of system cmake is being run on.

       The same as CMAKE_SYSTEM but for the host system instead of the target
       system when cross compiling.

  CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME
       Name of the OS CMake is running on.

       The same as CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME but for the host system instead of the
       target system when cross compiling.

  CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR
       The name of the CPU CMake is running on.

       The same as CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR but for the host system instead of
       the target system when cross compiling.

  CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_VERSION
       OS version CMake is running on.

       The same as CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION but for the host system instead of
       the target system when cross compiling.

  CMAKE_HOST_UNIX
       True for UNIX and UNIX like operating systems.

       Set to true when the host system is UNIX or UNIX like (i.e.  APPLE and
       CYGWIN).

  CMAKE_HOST_WIN32
       True on windows systems, including win64.

       Set to true when the host system is Windows and on cygwin.

  CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE
       Target architecture library directory name, if detected.

       This is the value of CMAKE_<lang>_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE as detected for
       one of the enabled languages.

  CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE_REGEX
       Regex matching possible target architecture library directory names.

       This is used to detect CMAKE_<lang>_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE from the
       implicit linker search path by matching the <arch> name.

  CMAKE_OBJECT_PATH_MAX
       Maximum object file full-path length allowed by native build tools.

       CMake computes for every source file an object file name that is
       unique to the source file and deterministic with respect to the full
       path to the source file.  This allows multiple source files in a
       target to share the same name if they lie in different directories
       without rebuilding when one is added or removed.  However, it can
       produce long full paths in a few cases, so CMake shortens the path
       using a hashing scheme when the full path to an object file exceeds a
       limit.  CMake has a built-in limit for each platform that is
       sufficient for common tools, but some native tools may have a lower
       limit.  This variable may be set to specify the limit explicitly.  The
       value must be an integer no less than 128.

  CMAKE_SYSTEM
       Name of system cmake is compiling for.

       This variable is the composite of CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME and
       CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION, like this
       ${CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME}-${CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION}.  If CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION
       is not set, then CMAKE_SYSTEM is the same as CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME.

  CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME
       Name of the OS CMake is building for.

       This is the name of the operating system on which CMake is targeting.
       On systems that have the uname command, this variable is set to the
       output of uname -s.  Linux, Windows, and Darwin for Mac OSX are the
       values found on the big three operating systems.

  CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR
       The name of the CPU CMake is building for.

       On systems that support uname, this variable is set to the output of
       uname -p, on windows it is set to the value of the environment
       variable PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE

  CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION
       OS version CMake is building for.

       A numeric version string for the system, on systems that support
       uname, this variable is set to the output of uname -r.  On other
       systems this is set to major-minor version numbers.

       Set to true when the compiler is version 7.0 of Microsoft Visual C.

  MSVC71
       True when using Microsoft Visual C 7.1

       Set to true when the compiler is version 7.1 of Microsoft Visual C.

  MSVC80
       True when using Microsoft Visual C 8.0

       Under the Xcode generator, this is the version of Xcode as specified
       in "Xcode.app/Contents/version.plist" (such as "3.1.2").

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Variables that Control the Build

  CMAKE_<CONFIG>_POSTFIX
       Default filename postfix for libraries under configuration <CONFIG>.

       When a non-executable target is created its <CONFIG>_POSTFIX target
       property is initialized with the value of this variable if it is set.

  CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
       Where to put all the ARCHIVE targets when built.

       This variable is used to initialize the ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
       property on all the targets.  See that target property for additional
       information.

  CMAKE_AUTOMOC
       Whether to handle moc automatically for Qt targets.

       This variable is used to initialize the AUTOMOC property on all the
       targets.  See that target property for additional information.

  CMAKE_AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS
       Additional options for moc when using automoc (see CMAKE_AUTOMOC).

       This variable is used to initialize the AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS property
       on all the targets.  See that target property for additional
       information.

  CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH
       Use the install path for the RPATH

       Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when building
       executables etc on systems that use RPATH.  When the software is
       installed the executables etc are relinked by CMake to have the
       install RPATH.  If this variable is set to true then the software is
       always built with the install path for the RPATH and does not need to
       be relinked when installed.

  CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX
       See variable CMAKE_<CONFIG>_POSTFIX.

       This variable is a special case of the more-general
       CMAKE_<CONFIG>_POSTFIX variable for the DEBUG configuration.

  CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS
       Linker flags used to create executables.

       Flags used by the linker when creating an executable.

  CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_[CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE]
       Flag used when linking an executable.

       Same as CMAKE_C_FLAGS_* but used by the linker when creating
       executables.

  CMAKE_Fortran_FORMAT
       Set to FIXED or FREE to indicate the Fortran source layout.

       This variable is used to initialize the Fortran_FORMAT property on all
       the targets.  See that target property for additional information.

  CMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY
       Fortran module output directory.

       This variable is used to initialize the Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY
       property on all the targets.  See that target property for additional
       information.

  CMAKE_GNUtoMS
       Convert GNU import libraries (.dll.a) to MS format (.lib).

       This variable is used to initialize the GNUtoMS property on targets
       when they are created.  See that target property for additional
       information.

  CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR
       Automatically add the current source- and build directories to the
       include path.

       If this variable is enabled, CMake automatically adds in each
       directory ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} and ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}
       to the include path for this directory.  These additional include
       directories do not propagate down to subdirectories.  This is useful
       mainly for out-of-source builds, where files generated into the build
       tree are included by files located in the source tree.

       By default CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR is OFF.

  CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR_IN_INTERFACE
       Automatically add the current source- and build directories to the
       INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES.

       If this variable is enabled, CMake automatically adds for each shared
       library target, static library target, module target and executable
       target, ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} and ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR} to
       the INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES.By default
       CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR_IN_INTERFACE is OFF.

  CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR
       Mac OSX directory name for installed targets.

       CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR is used to initialize the INSTALL_NAME_DIR
       property on all targets.  See that target property for more
       information.

  CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH
       The rpath to use for installed targets.

       A semicolon-separated list specifying the rpath to use in installed
       targets (for platforms that support it).  This is used to initialize
       the target property INSTALL_RPATH for all targets.

  CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH
       Add paths to linker search and installed rpath.

       CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH is a boolean that if set to true
       will append directories in the linker search path and outside the
       project to the INSTALL_RPATH.  This is used to initialize the target
       property INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH for all targets.

  CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
       Where to put all the LIBRARY targets when built.

       This variable is used to initialize the LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
       property on all the targets.  See that target property for additional
       information.

  CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH_FLAG
       The flag used to add a library search path to a compiler.

       The flag used to specify a library directory to the compiler.  On most
       compilers this is "-L".

  CMAKE_LINK_DEF_FILE_FLAG  
       Linker flag used to specify a .def file for dll creation.

       The flag used to add a .def file when creating a dll on Windows, this
       is only defined on Windows.

  CMAKE_LINK_DEPENDS_NO_SHARED
       Whether to skip link dependencies on shared library files.

       This variable initializes the LINK_DEPENDS_NO_SHARED property on
       targets when they are created.  See that target property for
       additional information.

  CMAKE_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
       Default value for LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES of targets.

       This variable is used to initialize the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
       property on all the targets.  See that target property for additional
       information.

  CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_FILE_FLAG
       Flag used to link a library specified by a path to its file.

       The flag used before a library file path is given to the linker.  This
       is needed only on very few platforms.

  CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_FLAG
       Flag used to link a library into an executable.

       The flag used to specify a library to link to an executable.  On most
       compilers this is "-l".

  CMAKE_MACOSX_BUNDLE
       Default value for MACOSX_BUNDLE of targets.

       This variable is used to initialize the MACOSX_BUNDLE property on all
       the targets.  See that target property for additional information.

  CMAKE_NO_BUILTIN_CHRPATH
       Do not use the builtin ELF editor to fix RPATHs on installation.

       When an ELF binary needs to have a different RPATH after installation
       than it does in the build tree, CMake uses a builtin editor to change
       the RPATH in the installed copy.  If this variable is set to true then
       CMake will relink the binary before installation instead of using its
       builtin editor.

  CMAKE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
       Where to put all the MS debug symbol files.

       This variable is used to initialize the PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY property
       on all the targets.  See that target property for additional
       information.

  CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE
       Default value for POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE of targets.

       This variable is used to initialize the POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE
       property on all the targets.  See that target property for additional
       information.

  CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
       Where to put all the RUNTIME targets when built.

       This variable is used to initialize the RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
       property on all the targets.  See that target property for additional
       information.

  CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH
       Do not include RPATHs in the build tree.

       Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when building
       executables etc on systems that use RPATH.  When the software is
       installed the executables etc are relinked by CMake to have the
       install RPATH.  If this variable is set to true then the software is
       always built with no RPATH.

  CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH
       Do not include RPATHs in the install tree.

       Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when building
       executables etc on systems that use RPATH.  When the software is
       installed the executables etc are relinked by CMake to have the
       install RPATH.  If this variable is set to true then the software is
       always installed without RPATH, even if RPATH is enabled when
       building.  This can be useful for example to allow running tests from
       the build directory with RPATH enabled before the installation step.
       To omit RPATH in both the build and install steps, use
       CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH instead.

  CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_CONFIGURATION
       Build configuration used for try_compile and try_run projects.

       Projects built by try_compile and try_run are built synchronously
       during the CMake configuration step.  Therefore a specific build
       configuration must be chosen even if the generated build system
       supports multiple configurations.

  CMAKE_USE_RELATIVE_PATHS
       Use relative paths (May not work!).

       If this is set to TRUE, then the CMake will use relative paths between
       the source and binary tree.  This option does not work for more
       complicated projects, and relative paths are used when possible.  In
       general, it is not possible to move CMake generated makefiles to a
       different location regardless of the value of this variable.

  CMAKE_WIN32_EXECUTABLE
       Default value for WIN32_EXECUTABLE of targets.

       This variable is used to initialize the WIN32_EXECUTABLE property on
       all the targets.  See that target property for additional information.

  EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH
       Old executable location variable.

       The target property RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY supercedes this variable
       for a target if it is set.  Executable targets are otherwise placed in
       this directory.

  LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH
       Old library location variable.

       The target properties ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY,
       LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, and RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY supercede this
       variable for a target if they are set.  Library targets are otherwise
       placed in this directory.

         XL, VisualAge, zOS = IBM XL (ibm.com)

       This variable is not guaranteed to be defined for all compilers or
       languages.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_LOADED
       Defined to true if the language is enabled.

       When language <LANG> is enabled by project() or enable_language() this
       variable is defined to 1.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION
       Compiler version string.

       Compiler version in major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]] format.  This
       variable is not guaranteed to be defined for all compilers or
       languages.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILE_OBJECT
       Rule variable to compile a single object file.

       This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to compile a single
       object file for for the language <LANG>.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY

       <LANG> flags used when CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is Debug.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_MINSIZEREL
       Flags for MinSizeRel build type or configuration.

       minimum size release.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_RELEASE
       Flags for Release build type or configuration.

       <LANG> flags used when CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is Release

  CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO
       Flags for RelWithDebInfo type or configuration.

       <LANG> flags used when CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is RelWithDebInfo.  Short for
       Release With Debug Information.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_IGNORE_EXTENSIONS
       File extensions that should be ignored by the build.

       This is a list of file extensions that may be part of a project for a
       given language but are not compiled.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
       Directories implicitly searched by the compiler for header files.

       CMake does not explicitly specify these directories on compiler
       command lines for language <LANG>.  This prevents system include
       directories from being treated as user include directories on some
       compilers.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_LINK_DIRECTORIES
       Implicit linker search path detected for language <LANG>.

       Compilers typically pass directories containing language runtime
       libraries and default library search paths when they invoke a linker.
       These paths are implicit linker search directories for the compiler's
       language.  CMake automatically detects these directories for each
       language and reports the results in this variable.

       When a library in one of these directories is given by full path to
       target_link_libraries() CMake will generate the -l<name> form on link
       lines to ensure the linker searches its implicit directories for the
       library.  Note that some toolchains read implicit directories from an
       environment variable such as LIBRARY_PATH so keep its value consistent
       when operating in a given build tree.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_LINK_FRAMEWORK_DIRECTORIES
       Implicit linker framework search path detected for language <LANG>.

       These paths are implicit linker framework search directories for the
       compiler's language.  CMake automatically detects these directories
       for each language and reports the results in this variable.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_LINK_LIBRARIES
       Implicit link libraries and flags detected for language <LANG>.

       Compilers typically pass language runtime library names and other
       flags when they invoke a linker.  These flags are implicit link
       options for the compiler's language.  CMake automatically detects
       these libraries and flags for each language and reports the results in
       this variable.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE
       Target architecture library directory name detected for <lang>.

       If the <lang> compiler passes to the linker an architecture-specific
       system library search directory such as <prefix>/lib/<arch> this
       variable contains the <arch> name if/as detected by CMake.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE
       Preference value for linker language selection.

       The "linker language" for executable, shared library, and module
       targets is the language whose compiler will invoke the linker.  The
       LINKER_LANGUAGE target property sets the language explicitly.
       Otherwise, the linker language is that whose linker preference value
       is highest among languages compiled and linked into the target.  See
       also the CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE_PROPAGATES variable.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE_PROPAGATES
       True if CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE propagates across targets.

       This is used when CMake selects a linker language for a target.
       Languages compiled directly into the target are always considered.  A
       language compiled into static libraries linked by the target is
       considered if this variable is true.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_LINK_EXECUTABLE 
       Rule variable to link and executable.

       Rule variable to link and executable for the given language.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_OUTPUT_EXTENSION
       Extension for the output of a compile for a single file.

       This is the extension for an object file for the given <LANG>.  For
       example .obj for C on Windows.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_PLATFORM_ID
       An internal variable subject to change.

       This is used in determining the platform and is subject to change.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_SIZEOF_DATA_PTR
       Size of pointer-to-data types for language <LANG>.

       This holds the size (in bytes) of pointer-to-data types in the target
       platform ABI.  It is defined for languages C and CXX (C++).

  CMAKE_<LANG>_SOURCE_FILE_EXTENSIONS
       Extensions of source files for the given language.

       This is the list of extensions for a given languages source files.

  CMAKE_COMPILER_IS_GNU<LANG>
       True if the compiler is GNU.

       If the selected <LANG> compiler is the GNU compiler then this is TRUE,
       if not it is FALSE.  Unlike the other per-language variables, this
       uses the GNU syntax for identifying languages instead of the CMake
       syntax.  Recognized values of the <LANG> suffix are:

         CC = C compiler
         CXX = C++ compiler
         G77 = Fortran compiler

  CMAKE_Fortran_MODDIR_DEFAULT
       Fortran default module output directory.

       Most Fortran compilers write .mod files to the current working
       directory.  For those that do not, this is set to "." and used when
       the Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY target property is not set.

  CMAKE_Fortran_MODDIR_FLAG
       Fortran flag for module output directory.

       This stores the flag needed to pass the value of the
       Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY target property to the compiler.

  CMAKE_Fortran_MODOUT_FLAG
       Fortran flag to enable module output.

       Most Fortran compilers write .mod files out by default.  For others,
       this stores the flag needed to enable module output.

  CMAKE_INTERNAL_PLATFORM_ABI
       An internal variable subject to change.

       This is used in determining the compiler ABI and is subject to change.

  CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE_<LANG>
       Specify a CMake file that overrides platform information for <LANG>.

       This is a language-specific version of CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE
       loaded only when enabling language <LANG>.
