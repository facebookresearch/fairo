<para>The "cmake-gui" executable is the CMake GUI.  Project configuration settings may be specified interactively.  Brief instructions are provided at the bottom of the window when the program is running.</para>
<para>CMake is a cross-platform build system generator.  Projects specify their build process with platform-independent CMake listfiles included in each directory of a source tree with the name CMakeLists.txt. Users build a project by using CMake to generate a build system for a native tool on their platform.</para>

<title>add_custom_command</title>
<abstract>
<para>Add a custom build rule to the generated build system.</para>
</abstract>
<para>There are two main signatures for add_custom_command The first signature is for adding a custom command to produce an output.
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  add_custom_command(OUTPUT output1 [output2 ...]
                     COMMAND command1 [ARGS] [args1...]
                     [COMMAND command2 [ARGS] [args2...] ...]
                     [MAIN_DEPENDENCY depend]
                     [DEPENDS [depends...]]
                     [IMPLICIT_DEPENDS &lt;lang1&gt; depend1
                                      [&lt;lang2&gt; depend2] ...]
                     [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]
                     [COMMENT comment] [VERBATIM] [APPEND])
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>This defines a command to generate specified OUTPUT file(s).  A target created in the same directory (CMakeLists.txt file) that specifies any output of the custom command as a source file is given a rule to generate the file using the command at build time.  Do not list the output in more than one independent target that may build in parallel or the two instances of the rule may conflict (instead use add_custom_target to drive the command and make the other targets depend on that one).  If an output name is a relative path it will be interpreted relative to the build tree directory corresponding to the current source directory. Note that MAIN_DEPENDENCY is completely optional and is used as a suggestion to visual studio about where to hang the custom command. In makefile terms this creates a new target in the following form:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  OUTPUT: MAIN_DEPENDENCY DEPENDS
          COMMAND
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>If more than one command is specified they will be executed in order. The optional ARGS argument is for backward compatibility and will be ignored.
</para>
<para>The second signature adds a custom command to a target such as a library or executable. This is useful for performing an operation before or after building the target. The command becomes part of the target and will only execute when the target itself is built.  If the target is already built, the command will not execute.
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  add_custom_command(TARGET target
                     PRE_BUILD | PRE_LINK | POST_BUILD
                     COMMAND command1 [ARGS] [args1...]
                     [COMMAND command2 [ARGS] [args2...] ...]
                     [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]
                     [COMMENT comment] [VERBATIM])
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>This defines a new command that will be associated with building the specified target. When the command will happen is determined by which of the following is specified:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  PRE_BUILD - run before all other dependencies
  PRE_LINK - run after other dependencies
  POST_BUILD - run after the target has been built
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>Note that the PRE_BUILD option is only supported on Visual Studio 7 or later. For all other generators PRE_BUILD will be treated as PRE_LINK.
</para>
<para>If WORKING_DIRECTORY is specified the command will be executed in the directory given. If it is a relative path it will be interpreted relative to the build tree directory corresponding to the current source directory. If COMMENT is set, the value will be displayed as a message before the commands are executed at build time. If APPEND is specified the COMMAND and DEPENDS option values are appended to the custom command for the first output specified. There must have already been a previous call to this command with the same output. The COMMENT, WORKING_DIRECTORY, and MAIN_DEPENDENCY options are currently ignored when APPEND is given, but may be used in the future.
</para>
<para>If VERBATIM is given then all arguments to the commands will be escaped properly for the build tool so that the invoked command receives each argument unchanged.  Note that one level of escapes is still used by the CMake language processor before add_custom_command even sees the arguments. Use of VERBATIM is recommended as it enables correct behavior. When VERBATIM is not given the behavior is platform specific because there is no protection of tool-specific special characters.
</para>
<para>If the output of the custom command is not actually created as a file on disk it should be marked as SYMBOLIC with SET_SOURCE_FILES_PROPERTIES.
</para>
<para>The IMPLICIT_DEPENDS option requests scanning of implicit dependencies of an input file.  The language given specifies the programming language whose corresponding dependency scanner should be used.  Currently only C and CXX language scanners are supported. The language has to be specified for every file in the IMPLICIT_DEPENDS list. Dependencies discovered from the scanning are added to those of the custom command at build time.  Note that the IMPLICIT_DEPENDS option is currently supported only for Makefile generators and will be ignored by other generators.
</para>
<para>If COMMAND specifies an executable target (created by ADD_EXECUTABLE) it will automatically be replaced by the location of the executable created at build time.  Additionally a target-level dependency will be added so that the executable target will be built before any target using this custom command.  However this does NOT add a file-level dependency that would cause the custom command to re-run whenever the executable is recompiled.
</para>
<para>Arguments to COMMAND may use "generator expressions" with the syntax "$&lt;...&gt;".  Generator expressions are evaluted during build system generation to produce information specific to each build configuration.  Valid expressions are:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  $&lt;0:...&gt;                  = empty string (ignores "...")
  $&lt;1:...&gt;                  = content of "..."
  $&lt;CONFIG:cfg&gt;             = '1' if config is "cfg", else '0'
  $&lt;CONFIGURATION&gt;          = configuration name
  $&lt;BOOL:...&gt;               = '1' if the '...' is true, else '0'
  $&lt;STREQUAL:a,b&gt;           = '1' if a is STREQUAL b, else '0'
  $&lt;ANGLE-R&gt;                = A literal '&gt;'. Used to compare strings which contain a '&gt;' for example.
  $&lt;COMMA&gt;                  = A literal ','. Used to compare strings which contain a ',' for example.
  $&lt;SEMICOLON&gt;              = A literal ';'. Used to prevent list expansion on an argument with ';'.
  $&lt;TARGET_NAME:...&gt;        = Marks ... as being the name of a target.  This is required if exporting targets to multiple dependent export sets.  The '...' must be a literal name of a target- it may not contain generator expressions.
  $&lt;INSTALL_INTERFACE:...&gt;  = content of "..." when the property is exported using install(EXPORT), and empty otherwise.
  $&lt;BUILD_INTERFACE:...&gt;    = content of "..." when the property is exported using export(), or when the target is used by another target in the same buildsystem. Expands to the empty string otherwise.
  $&lt;TARGET_FILE:tgt&gt;        = main file (.exe, .so.1.2, .a)
  $&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE:tgt&gt; = file used to link (.a, .lib, .so)
  $&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE:tgt&gt; = file with soname (.so.3)
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>where "tgt" is the name of a target.  Target file expressions produce a full path, but _DIR and _NAME versions can produce the directory and file name components:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  $&lt;TARGET_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
  $&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
  $&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  $&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,prop&gt;   = The value of the property prop on the target tgt.
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>Note that tgt is not added as a dependency of the target this expression is evaluated on.
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  $&lt;TARGET_POLICY:pol&gt;          = '1' if the policy was NEW when the 'head' target was created, else '0'.  If the policy was not set, the warning message for the policy will be emitted.  This generator expression only works for a subset of policies.
  $&lt;INSTALL_PREFIX&gt;         = Content of the install prefix when the target is exported via INSTALL(EXPORT) and empty otherwise.
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>Boolean expressions:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  $&lt;AND:?[,?]...&gt;           = '1' if all '?' are '1', else '0'
  $&lt;OR:?[,?]...&gt;            = '0' if all '?' are '0', else '1'
  $&lt;NOT:?&gt;                  = '0' if '?' is '1', else '1'
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>where '?' is always either '0' or '1'.
</para>
<para>Expressions with an implicit 'this' target:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  $&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:prop&gt;   = The value of the property prop on the target on which the generator expression is evaluated.
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>References to target names in generator expressions imply target-level dependencies, but NOT file-level dependencies.  List target names with the DEPENDS option to add file dependencies.
</para>
<para>The DEPENDS option specifies files on which the command depends.  If any dependency is an OUTPUT of another custom command in the same directory (CMakeLists.txt file) CMake automatically brings the other custom command into the target in which this command is built.  If DEPENDS is not specified the command will run whenever the OUTPUT is missing; if the command does not actually create the OUTPUT then the rule will always run.  If DEPENDS specifies any target (created by an ADD_* command) a target-level dependency is created to make sure the target is built before any target using this custom command.  Additionally, if the target is an executable or library a file-level dependency is created to cause the custom command to re-run whenever the target is recompiled.

<para>Adds a target with the given name that executes the given commands. The target has no output file and is ALWAYS CONSIDERED OUT OF DATE even if the commands try to create a file with the name of the target. Use ADD_CUSTOM_COMMAND to generate a file with dependencies. By default nothing depends on the custom target. Use ADD_DEPENDENCIES to add dependencies to or from other targets. If the ALL option is specified it indicates that this target should be added to the default build target so that it will be run every time (the command cannot be called ALL). The command and arguments are optional and if not specified an empty target will be created. If WORKING_DIRECTORY is set, then the command will be run in that directory. If it is a relative path it will be interpreted relative to the build tree directory corresponding to the current source directory. If COMMENT is set, the value will be displayed as a message before the commands are executed at build time. Dependencies listed with the DEPENDS argument may reference files and outputs of custom commands created with add_custom_command() in the same directory (CMakeLists.txt file).
</para>
<para>If VERBATIM is given then all arguments to the commands will be escaped properly for the build tool so that the invoked command receives each argument unchanged.

Adding dependencies with this command can be used to make sure one target is built before another target.  Dependencies added to an IMPORTED target are followed transitively in its place since the target itself does not build.  See the DEPENDS option of ADD_CUSTOM_TARGET and ADD_CUSTOM_COMMAND for adding file-level dependencies in custom rules.  See the OBJECT_DEPENDS option in SET_SOURCE_FILES_PROPERTIES to add file-level dependencies to object files.</para>

</programlisting>
</para>
<para>Adds an executable target called &lt;name&gt; to be built from the source files listed in the command invocation.  The &lt;name&gt; corresponds to the logical target name and must be globally unique within a project.  The actual file name of the executable built is constructed based on conventions of the native platform (such as &lt;name&gt;.exe or just &lt;name&gt;).  
</para>
<para>By default the executable file will be created in the build tree directory corresponding to the source tree directory in which the command was invoked.  See documentation of the RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY target property to change this location.  See documentation of the OUTPUT_NAME target property to change the &lt;name&gt; part of the final file name.  
</para>
<para>If WIN32 is given the property WIN32_EXECUTABLE will be set on the target created.  See documentation of that target property for details.

</para>
<para>If EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL is given the corresponding property will be set on the created target.  See documentation of the EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL target property for details.
</para>
<para>The add_executable command can also create IMPORTED executable targets using this signature:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  add_executable(&lt;name&gt; IMPORTED [GLOBAL])
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>An IMPORTED executable target references an executable file located outside the project.  No rules are generated to build it.  The target name has scope in the directory in which it is created and below, but the GLOBAL option extends visibility.  It may be referenced like any target built within the project.  IMPORTED executables are useful for convenient reference from commands like add_custom_command.  Details about the imported executable are specified by setting properties whose names begin in "IMPORTED_".  The most important such property is IMPORTED_LOCATION (and its per-configuration version IMPORTED_LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;) which specifies the location of the main executable file on disk.  See documentation of the IMPORTED_* properties for more information.</para>

</para>
<para>Adds a library target called &lt;name&gt; to be built from the source files listed in the command invocation.  The &lt;name&gt; corresponds to the logical target name and must be globally unique within a project.  The actual file name of the library built is constructed based on conventions of the native platform (such as lib&lt;name&gt;.a or &lt;name&gt;.lib).
</para>
<para>STATIC, SHARED, or MODULE may be given to specify the type of library to be created.  STATIC libraries are archives of object files for use when linking other targets.  SHARED libraries are linked dynamically and loaded at runtime.  MODULE libraries are plugins that are not linked into other targets but may be loaded dynamically at runtime using dlopen-like functionality.  If no type is given explicitly the type is STATIC or SHARED based on whether the current value of the variable BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is true.  For SHARED and MODULE libraries the POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE target property is set to TRUE automatically.
</para>
<para>By default the library file will be created in the build tree directory corresponding to the source tree directory in which the command was invoked.  See documentation of the ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, and RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY target properties to change this location.  See documentation of the OUTPUT_NAME target property to change the &lt;name&gt; part of the final file name.  
</para>
<para>If EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL is given the corresponding property will be set on the created target.  See documentation of the EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL target property for details.

The target name has scope in the directory in which it is created and below, but the GLOBAL option extends visibility.  It may be referenced like any target built within the project.  IMPORTED libraries are useful for convenient reference from commands like target_link_libraries.  Details about the imported library are specified by setting properties whose names begin in "IMPORTED_".  The most important such property is IMPORTED_LOCATION (and its per-configuration version IMPORTED_LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;) which specifies the location of the main library file on disk.  See documentation of the IMPORTED_* properties for more information.

<para>
<programlisting>  add_library(&lt;name&gt; OBJECT &lt;src&gt;...)
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>creates a special "object library" target.  An object library compiles source files but does not archive or link their object files into a library.  Instead other targets created by add_library or add_executable may reference the objects using an expression of the form $&lt;TARGET_OBJECTS:objlib&gt; as a source, where "objlib" is the object library name.  For example:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  add_library(... $&lt;TARGET_OBJECTS:objlib&gt; ...)
  add_executable(... $&lt;TARGET_OBJECTS:objlib&gt; ...)
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>will include objlib's object files in a library and an executable along with those compiled from their own sources.  Object libraries may contain only sources (and headers) that compile to object files.  They may contain custom commands generating such sources, but not PRE_BUILD, PRE_LINK, or POST_BUILD commands.  Object libraries cannot be imported, exported, installed, or linked.  Some native build systems may not like targets that have only object files, so consider adding at least one real source file to any target that references $&lt;TARGET_OBJECTS:objlib&gt;.</para>

</programlisting>
</para>
<para>Add a subdirectory to the build. The source_dir specifies the directory in which the source CmakeLists.txt and code files are located. If it is a relative path it will be evaluated with respect to the current directory (the typical usage), but it may also be an absolute path. The binary_dir specifies the directory in which to place the output files. If it is a relative path it will be evaluated with respect to the current output directory, but it may also be an absolute path. If binary_dir is not specified, the value of source_dir, before expanding any relative path, will be used (the typical usage). The CMakeLists.txt file in the specified source directory will be processed immediately by CMake before processing in the current input file continues beyond this command.
</para>
<para>If the EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL argument is provided then targets in the subdirectory will not be included in the ALL target of the parent directory by default, and will be excluded from IDE project files.  Users must explicitly build targets in the subdirectory.  This is meant for use when the subdirectory contains a separate part of the project that is useful but not necessary, such as a set of examples.  Typically the subdirectory should contain its own project() command invocation so that a full build system will be generated in the subdirectory (such as a VS IDE solution file).  Note that inter-target dependencies supercede this exclusion.  If a target built by the parent project depends on a target in the subdirectory, the dependee target will be included in the parent project build system to satisfy the dependency.</para>

<para>It is tempting to use this command to avoid writing the list of source files for a library or executable target.  While this seems to work, there is no way for CMake to generate a build system that knows when a new source file has been added.  Normally the generated build system knows when it needs to rerun CMake because the CMakeLists.txt file is modified to add a new source.  When the source is just added to the directory without modifying this file, one would have to manually rerun CMake to generate a build system incorporating the new file.</para>

<title>cmake_policy</title>
<abstract>
<para>Manage CMake Policy settings.</para>
</abstract>
<para>As CMake evolves it is sometimes necessary to change existing behavior in order to fix bugs or improve implementations of existing features.  The CMake Policy mechanism is designed to help keep existing projects building as new versions of CMake introduce changes in behavior.  Each new policy (behavioral change) is given an identifier of the form "CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;" where "&lt;NNNN&gt;" is an integer index.  Documentation associated with each policy describes the OLD and NEW behavior and the reason the policy was introduced.  Projects may set each policy to select the desired behavior.  When CMake needs to know which behavior to use it checks for a setting specified by the project.  If no setting is available the OLD behavior is assumed and a warning is produced requesting that the policy be set.
</para>
<para>The cmake_policy command is used to set policies to OLD or NEW behavior.  While setting policies individually is supported, we encourage projects to set policies based on CMake versions.
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  cmake_policy(VERSION major.minor[.patch[.tweak]])
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>Specify that the current CMake list file is written for the given version of CMake.  All policies introduced in the specified version or earlier will be set to use NEW behavior.  All policies introduced after the specified version will be unset (unless variable CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; sets a default).  This effectively requests behavior preferred as of a given CMake version and tells newer CMake versions to warn about their new policies.  The policy version specified must be at least 2.4 or the command will report an error.  In order to get compatibility features supporting versions earlier than 2.4 see documentation of policy CMP0001.
</para>

<programlisting>  cmake_policy(SET CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; NEW)
  cmake_policy(SET CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; OLD)
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>Tell CMake to use the OLD or NEW behavior for a given policy.  Projects depending on the old behavior of a given policy may silence a policy warning by setting the policy state to OLD.  Alternatively one may fix the project to work with the new behavior and set the policy state to NEW.
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  cmake_policy(GET CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; &lt;variable&gt;)
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>Check whether a given policy is set to OLD or NEW behavior.  The output variable value will be "OLD" or "NEW" if the policy is set, and empty otherwise.
</para>
<para>CMake keeps policy settings on a stack, so changes made by the cmake_policy command affect only the top of the stack.  A new entry on the policy stack is managed automatically for each subdirectory to protect its parents and siblings.  CMake also manages a new entry for scripts loaded by include() and find_package() commands except when invoked with the NO_POLICY_SCOPE option (see also policy CMP0011).  The cmake_policy command provides an interface to manage custom entries on the policy stack:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  cmake_policy(PUSH)
  cmake_policy(POP)
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>Each PUSH must have a matching POP to erase any changes.  This is useful to make temporary changes to policy settings.
</para>
<para>Functions and macros record policy settings when they are created and use the pre-record policies when they are invoked.  If the function or macro implementation sets policies, the changes automatically propagate up through callers until they reach the closest nested policy stack entry.</para>

This is useful when building static executables with large libraries to shrink the total required size.  The list of source files needed to build the test driver will be in sourceListName.  DriverName is the name of the test driver program.  The rest of the arguments consist of a list of test source files, can be semicolon separated.  Each test source file should have a function in it that is the same name as the file with no extension (foo.cxx should have int foo(int, char*[]);) DriverName will be able to call each of the tests by name on the command line. If EXTRA_INCLUDE is specified, then the next argument is included into the generated file. If FUNCTION is specified, then the next argument is taken as a function name that is passed a pointer to ac and av.  This can be used to add extra command line processing to each test.

<para>Runs the given sequence of one or more commands with the standard output of each process piped to the standard input of the next.  A single standard error pipe is used for all processes.  If WORKING_DIRECTORY is given the named directory will be set as the current working directory of the child processes.  If TIMEOUT is given the child processes will be terminated if they do not finish in the specified number of seconds (fractions are allowed).  If RESULT_VARIABLE is given the variable will be set to contain the result of running the processes.  This will be an integer return code from the last child or a string describing an error condition.  If OUTPUT_VARIABLE or ERROR_VARIABLE are given the variable named will be set with the contents of the standard output and standard error pipes respectively.  If the same variable is named for both pipes their output will be merged in the order produced.  If INPUT_FILE, OUTPUT_FILE, or ERROR_FILE is given the file named will be attached to the standard input of the first process, standard output of the last process, or standard error of all processes respectively.  If OUTPUT_QUIET or ERROR_QUIET is given then the standard output or standard error results will be quietly ignored.  If more than one OUTPUT_* or ERROR_* option is given for the same pipe the precedence is not specified.  If no OUTPUT_* or ERROR_* options are given the output will be shared with the corresponding pipes of the CMake process itself.

<para>WRITE will write a message into a file called 'filename'. It overwrites the file if it already exists, and creates the file if it does not exist. (If the file is a build input, use configure_file to update the file only when its content changes.)
</para>
<para>APPEND will write a message into a file same as WRITE, except it will append it to the end of the file
</para>
<para>READ will read the content of a file and store it into the variable. It will start at the given offset and read up to numBytes. If the argument HEX is given, the binary data will be converted to hexadecimal representation and this will be stored in the variable.
</para>
<para>MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 will compute a cryptographic hash of the content of a file.
</para>
<para>STRINGS will parse a list of ASCII strings from a file and store it in a variable. Binary data in the file are ignored. Carriage return (CR) characters are ignored. It works also for Intel Hex and Motorola S-record files, which are automatically converted to binary format when reading them. Disable this using NO_HEX_CONVERSION.
</para>
<para>LIMIT_COUNT sets the maximum number of strings to return. LIMIT_INPUT sets the maximum number of bytes to read from the input file. LIMIT_OUTPUT sets the maximum number of bytes to store in the output variable. LENGTH_MINIMUM sets the minimum length of a string to return. Shorter strings are ignored. LENGTH_MAXIMUM sets the maximum length of a string to return.  Longer strings are split into strings no longer than the maximum length. NEWLINE_CONSUME allows newlines to be included in strings instead of terminating them.

<para>REGEX specifies a regular expression that a string must match to be returned. Typical usage 
</para>
<para>

</para>
<para>stores a list in the variable "myfile" in which each item is a line from the input file.
</para>
<para>GLOB will generate a list of all files that match the globbing expressions and store it into the variable. Globbing expressions are similar to regular expressions, but much simpler. If RELATIVE flag is specified for an expression, the results will be returned as a relative path to the given path.  (We do not recommend using GLOB to collect a list of source files from your source tree.  If no CMakeLists.txt file changes when a source is added or removed then the generated build system cannot know when to ask CMake to regenerate.)
</para>
<para>Examples of globbing expressions include:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   *.cxx      - match all files with extension cxx

   f[3-5].txt - match files f3.txt, f4.txt, f5.txt
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>GLOB_RECURSE will generate a list similar to the regular GLOB, except it will traverse all the subdirectories of the matched directory and match the files. Subdirectories that are symlinks are only traversed if FOLLOW_SYMLINKS is given or cmake policy CMP0009 is not set to NEW. See cmake --help-policy CMP0009 for more information.

<para>RELATIVE_PATH will determine relative path from directory to the given file.
</para>
<para>TO_CMAKE_PATH will convert path into a cmake style path with unix /.  The input can be a single path or a system path like "$ENV{PATH}".  Note the double quotes around the ENV call TO_CMAKE_PATH only takes  one argument. This command will also convert the native list delimiters for a list of paths like the PATH environment variable.
</para>
<para>TO_NATIVE_PATH works just like TO_CMAKE_PATH, but will convert from  a cmake style path into the native path style \ for windows and / for UNIX.
</para>
<para>DOWNLOAD will download the given URL to the given file. If LOG var is specified a log of the download will be put in var. If STATUS var is specified the status of the operation will be put in var. The status is returned in a list of length 2. The first element is the numeric return value for the operation, and the second element is a string value for the error. A 0 numeric error means no error in the operation. If TIMEOUT time is specified, the operation will timeout after time seconds, time should be specified as an integer. The INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT specifies an integer number of seconds of inactivity after which the operation should terminate. If EXPECTED_HASH ALGO=value is specified, the operation will verify that the downloaded file's actual hash matches the expected value, where ALGO is one of MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, or SHA512.  If it does not match, the operation fails with an error. ("EXPECTED_MD5 sum" is short-hand for "EXPECTED_HASH MD5=sum".) If SHOW_PROGRESS is specified, progress information will be printed as status messages until the operation is complete. For https URLs CMake must be built with OpenSSL.  TLS/SSL certificates are not checked by default.  Set TLS_VERIFY to ON to check certificates and/or use EXPECTED_HASH to verify downloaded content.  Set TLS_CAINFO to specify a custom Certificate Authority file.  If either TLS option is not given CMake will check variables CMAKE_TLS_VERIFY and CMAKE_TLS_CAINFO, respectively.
</para>
<para>UPLOAD will upload the given file to the given URL. If LOG var is specified a log of the upload will be put in var. If STATUS var is specified the status of the operation will be put in var. The status is returned in a list of length 2. The first element is the numeric return value for the operation, and the second element is a string value for the error. A 0 numeric error means no error in the operation. If TIMEOUT time is specified, the operation will timeout after time seconds, time should be specified as an integer. The INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT specifies an integer number of seconds of inactivity after which the operation should terminate. If SHOW_PROGRESS is specified, progress information will be printed as status messages until the operation is complete.

<para>The file() command also provides COPY and INSTALL signatures:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  file(&lt;COPY|INSTALL&gt; files... DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;
       [FILE_PERMISSIONS permissions...]
       [DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS permissions...]

       [FILES_MATCHING]
       [[PATTERN &lt;pattern&gt; | REGEX &lt;regex&gt;]
        [EXCLUDE] [PERMISSIONS permissions...]] [...])
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>The COPY signature copies files, directories, and symlinks to a destination folder.  Relative input paths are evaluated with respect to the current source directory, and a relative destination is evaluated with respect to the current build directory.  Copying preserves input file timestamps, and optimizes out a file if it exists at the destination with the same timestamp.  Copying preserves input permissions unless explicit permissions or NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS are given (default is USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS).  See the install(DIRECTORY) command for documentation of permissions, PATTERN, REGEX, and EXCLUDE options.  
</para>
<para>The INSTALL signature differs slightly from COPY: it prints status messages, and NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS is default.  Installation scripts generated by the install() command use this signature (with some undocumented options for internal use).</para>

</para>
<para>This command is used to find a full path to named file. A cache entry named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the result of this command.  If the full path to a file is found the result is stored in the variable and the search will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared.  If nothing is found, the result will be &lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again the next time find_file is invoked with the same variable.  The name of the full path to a file that is searched for is specified by the names listed after the NAMES argument.   Additional search locations can be specified after the PATHS argument.  If ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section the environment variable var will be read and converted from a system environment variable to a cmake style list of paths.  For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the system path variable. The argument after DOC will be used for the documentation string in the cache.  PATH_SUFFIXES specifies additional subdirectories to check below each search path.

<para>The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or more directories to be prepended to all other search directories. This effectively "re-roots" the entire search under given locations. By default it is empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will search there too. By default at first the directories listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted directories will be searched. The default behavior can be adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE.  This behavior can be manually overridden on a per-call basis.

<para>When more than one value is given to the NAMES option this command by default will consider one name at a time and search every directory for it.  The NAMES_PER_DIR option tells this command to consider one directory at a time and search for all names in it.
</para>
<para>If the library found is a framework, then VAR will be set to the full path to the framework &lt;fullPath&gt;/A.framework. When a full path to a framework is used as a library, CMake will use a -framework A, and a -F&lt;fullPath&gt; to link the framework to the target.
</para>
<para>If the global property FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS is set all search paths will be tested as normal, with "64/" appended, and with all matches of "lib/" replaced with "lib64/".

<para>Finds and loads settings from an external project.  &lt;package&gt;_FOUND will be set to indicate whether the package was found.  When the package is found package-specific information is provided through variables and imported targets documented by the package itself.  The QUIET option disables messages if the package cannot be found.  The MODULE option disables the second signature documented below.  The REQUIRED option stops processing with an error message if the package cannot be found.
</para>
<para>A package-specific list of required components may be listed after the COMPONENTS option (or after the REQUIRED option if present).  Additional optional components may be listed after OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS.  Available components and their influence on whether a package is considered to be found are defined by the target package.
</para>
<para>The [version] argument requests a version with which the package found should be compatible (format is major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]).  The EXACT option requests that the version be matched exactly.  If no [version] and/or component list is given to a recursive invocation inside a find-module, the corresponding arguments are forwarded automatically from the outer call (including the EXACT flag for [version]).  Version support is currently provided only on a package-by-package basis (details below).
</para>
<para>User code should generally look for packages using the above simple signature.  The remainder of this command documentation specifies the full command signature and details of the search process.  Project maintainers wishing to provide a package to be found by this command are encouraged to read on.
</para>
<para>The command has two modes by which it searches for packages: "Module" mode and "Config" mode.  Module mode is available when the command is invoked with the above reduced signature.  CMake searches for a file called "Find&lt;package&gt;.cmake" in the CMAKE_MODULE_PATH followed by the CMake installation.  If the file is found, it is read and processed by CMake.  It is responsible for finding the package, checking the version, and producing any needed messages.  Many find-modules provide limited or no support for versioning; check the module documentation.  If no module is found and the MODULE option is not given the command proceeds to Config mode.
</para>
<para>The complete Config mode command signature is:

</programlisting>
</para>
<para>The CONFIG option may be used to skip Module mode explicitly and switch to Config mode.  It is synonymous to using NO_MODULE.  Config mode is also implied by use of options not specified in the reduced signature.  
</para>
<para>Config mode attempts to locate a configuration file provided by the package to be found.  A cache entry called &lt;package&gt;_DIR is created to hold the directory containing the file.  By default the command searches for a package with the name &lt;package&gt;.  If the NAMES option is given the names following it are used instead of &lt;package&gt;.  The command searches for a file called "&lt;name&gt;Config.cmake" or "&lt;lower-case-name&gt;-config.cmake" for each name specified.  A replacement set of possible configuration file names may be given using the CONFIGS option.  The search procedure is specified below.  Once found, the configuration file is read and processed by CMake.  Since the file is provided by the package it already knows the location of package contents.  The full path to the configuration file is stored in the cmake variable &lt;package&gt;_CONFIG.
</para>
<para>All configuration files which have been considered by CMake while searching for an installation of the package with an appropriate version are stored in the cmake variable &lt;package&gt;_CONSIDERED_CONFIGS, the associated versions in &lt;package&gt;_CONSIDERED_VERSIONS. 
</para>
<para>If the package configuration file cannot be found CMake will generate an error describing the problem unless the QUIET argument is specified.  If REQUIRED is specified and the package is not found a fatal error is generated and the configure step stops executing.  If &lt;package&gt;_DIR has been set to a directory not containing a configuration file CMake will ignore it and search from scratch.
</para>
<para>When the [version] argument is given Config mode will only find a version of the package that claims compatibility with the requested version (format is major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]).  If the EXACT option is given only a version of the package claiming an exact match of the requested version may be found.  CMake does not establish any convention for the meaning of version numbers.  Package version numbers are checked by "version" files provided by the packages themselves.  For a candidate package configuration file "&lt;config-file&gt;.cmake" the corresponding version file is located next to it and named either "&lt;config-file&gt;-version.cmake" or "&lt;config-file&gt;Version.cmake".  If no such version file is available then the configuration file is assumed to not be compatible with any requested version.  A basic version file containing generic version matching code can be created using the macro write_basic_package_version_file(), see its documentation for more details.  When a version file is found it is loaded to check the requested version number.  The version file is loaded in a nested scope in which the following variables have been defined:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  PACKAGE_FIND_NAME          = the &lt;package&gt; name
  PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION       = full requested version string
  PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MAJOR = major version if requested, else 0
  PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if requested, else 0
  PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_PATCH = patch version if requested, else 0
  PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_TWEAK = tweak version if requested, else 0
  PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_COUNT = number of version components, 0 to 4
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>The version file checks whether it satisfies the requested version and sets these variables:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  PACKAGE_VERSION            = full provided version string
  PACKAGE_VERSION_EXACT      = true if version is exact match
  PACKAGE_VERSION_COMPATIBLE = true if version is compatible
  PACKAGE_VERSION_UNSUITABLE = true if unsuitable as any version
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>These variables are checked by the find_package command to determine whether the configuration file provides an acceptable version.  They are not available after the find_package call returns.  If the version is acceptable the following variables are set:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  &lt;package&gt;_VERSION       = full provided version string
  &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_MAJOR = major version if provided, else 0
  &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if provided, else 0
  &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_PATCH = patch version if provided, else 0
  &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_TWEAK = tweak version if provided, else 0
  &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_COUNT = number of version components, 0 to 4
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>and the corresponding package configuration file is loaded.  When multiple package configuration files are available whose version files claim compatibility with the version requested it is unspecified which one is chosen.  No attempt is made to choose a highest or closest version number.
</para>
<para>Config mode provides an elaborate interface and search procedure.  Much of the interface is provided for completeness and for use internally by find-modules loaded by Module mode.  Most user code should simply call

</programlisting>
</para>
<para>In all cases the &lt;name&gt; is treated as case-insensitive and corresponds to any of the names specified (&lt;package&gt; or names given by NAMES).  Paths with lib/&lt;arch&gt; are enabled if CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set.  If PATH_SUFFIXES is specified the suffixes are appended to each (W) or (U) directory entry one-by-one.
</para>
<para>This set of directories is intended to work in cooperation with projects that provide configuration files in their installation trees.  Directories above marked with (W) are intended for installations on Windows where the prefix may point at the top of an application's installation directory.  Those marked with (U) are intended for installations on UNIX platforms where the prefix is shared by multiple packages.  This is merely a convention, so all (W) and (U) directories are still searched on all platforms.  Directories marked with (A) are intended for installations on Apple platforms.  The cmake variables CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK and CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE determine the order of preference as specified below.

<para>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the cmake variable    CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or one of the following:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   "FIRST"  - Try to find frameworks before standard
              libraries or headers. This is the default on Darwin.
   "LAST"   - Try to find frameworks after standard
              libraries or headers.
   "ONLY"   - Only try to find frameworks.
   "NEVER" - Never try to find frameworks.
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one of the following:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   "FIRST"  - Try to find application bundles before standard
              programs. This is the default on Darwin.
   "LAST"   - Try to find application bundles after standard
              programs.
   "ONLY"   - Only try to find application bundles.
   "NEVER" - Never try to find application bundles.
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or more directories to be prepended to all other search directories. This effectively "re-roots" the entire search under given locations. By default it is empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will search there too. By default at first the directories listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted directories will be searched. The default behavior can be adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE.  This behavior can be manually overridden on a per-call basis. By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted directories will be searched.
</para>
<para>The default search order is designed to be most-specific to least-specific for common use cases.  Projects may override the order by simply calling the command multiple times and using the NO_* options:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   find_package(&lt;package&gt; PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
   find_package(&lt;package&gt;)
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search again.
</para>
<para>Every non-REQUIRED find_package() call can be disabled by setting the variable CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;package&gt; to TRUE. See the documentation for the CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;package&gt; variable for more information.
</para>
<para>When loading a find module or package configuration file find_package defines variables to provide information about the call arguments (and restores their original state before returning):
</para>
<para>
<programlisting> &lt;package&gt;_FIND_REQUIRED      = true if REQUIRED option was given
 &lt;package&gt;_FIND_QUIETLY       = true if QUIET option was given
 &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION       = full requested version string
 &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_MAJOR = major version if requested, else 0
 &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if requested, else 0
 &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_PATCH = patch version if requested, else 0
 &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_TWEAK = tweak version if requested, else 0
 &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_COUNT = number of version components, 0 to 4
 &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_EXACT = true if EXACT option was given
 &lt;package&gt;_FIND_COMPONENTS    = list of requested components
 &lt;package&gt;_FIND_REQUIRED_&lt;c&gt;  = true if component &lt;c&gt; is required
                                false if component &lt;c&gt; is optional
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>In Module mode the loaded find module is responsible to honor the request detailed by these variables; see the find module for details.  In Config mode find_package handles REQUIRED, QUIET, and version options automatically but leaves it to the package configuration file to handle components in a way that makes sense for the package.  The package configuration file may set &lt;package&gt;_FOUND to false to tell find_package that component requirements are not satisfied.

<para>This command is used to find a directory containing the named file. A cache entry named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the result of this command.  If the file in a directory is found the result is stored in the variable and the search will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared.  If nothing is found, the result will be &lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again the next time find_path is invoked with the same variable.  The name of the file in a directory that is searched for is specified by the names listed after the NAMES argument.   Additional search locations can be specified after the PATHS argument.  If ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section the environment variable var will be read and converted from a system environment variable to a cmake style list of paths.  For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the system path variable. The argument after DOC will be used for the documentation string in the cache.

<para>This command is used to find a program. A cache entry named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the result of this command.  If the program is found the result is stored in the variable and the search will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared.  If nothing is found, the result will be &lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again the next time find_program is invoked with the same variable.  The name of the program that is searched for is specified by the names listed after the NAMES argument.   Additional search locations can be specified after the PATHS argument.  If ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section the environment variable var will be read and converted from a system environment variable to a cmake style list of paths.  For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the system path variable. The argument after DOC will be used for the documentation string in the cache.  PATH_SUFFIXES specifies additional subdirectories to check below each search path.
</para>
<para>If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional paths are added to the search. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not specified, the search process is as follows:

</para>
<para>The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or more directories to be prepended to all other search directories. This effectively "re-roots" the entire search under given locations. By default it is empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will search there too. By default at first the directories listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted directories will be searched. The default behavior can be adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM.  This behavior can be manually overridden on a per-call basis. By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted directories will be searched.

In addition to referencing the formal parameters you can reference the variable ARGC which will be set to the number of arguments passed into the function as well as ARGV0 ARGV1 ARGV2 ... which will have the actual values of the arguments passed in. This facilitates creating functions with optional arguments. Additionally ARGV holds the list of all arguments given to the function and ARGN holds the list of arguments past the last expected argument.

<para>If a module is specified instead of a file, the file with name &lt;modulename&gt;.cmake is searched first in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH, then in the CMake module directory. There is one exception to this: if the file which calls include() is located itself in the CMake module directory, then first the CMake module directory is searched and CMAKE_MODULE_PATH afterwards.

<title>install</title>
<abstract>
<para>Specify rules to run at install time.</para>
</abstract>
<para>This command generates installation rules for a project.  Rules specified by calls to this command within a source directory are executed in order during installation.  The order across directories is not defined.
</para>
<para>There are multiple signatures for this command.  Some of them define installation properties for files and targets.  Properties common to multiple signatures are covered here but they are valid only for signatures that specify them.
</para>
<para>DESTINATION arguments specify the directory on disk to which a file will be installed.  If a full path (with a leading slash or drive letter) is given it is used directly.  If a relative path is given it is interpreted relative to the value of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. The prefix can be relocated at install time using DESTDIR mechanism explained in the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable documentation.
</para>
<para>PERMISSIONS arguments specify permissions for installed files.  Valid permissions are OWNER_READ, OWNER_WRITE, OWNER_EXECUTE, GROUP_READ, GROUP_WRITE, GROUP_EXECUTE, WORLD_READ, WORLD_WRITE, WORLD_EXECUTE, SETUID, and SETGID.  Permissions that do not make sense on certain platforms are ignored on those platforms.
</para>
<para>The CONFIGURATIONS argument specifies a list of build configurations for which the install rule applies (Debug, Release, etc.).
</para>
<para>The COMPONENT argument specifies an installation component name with which the install rule is associated, such as "runtime" or "development".  During component-specific installation only install rules associated with the given component name will be executed.  During a full installation all components are installed. If COMPONENT is not provided a default component "Unspecified" is created. The default component name may be controlled with the CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_COMPONENT_NAME variable.
</para>
<para>The RENAME argument specifies a name for an installed file that may be different from the original file.  Renaming is allowed only when a single file is installed by the command.
</para>
<para>The OPTIONAL argument specifies that it is not an error if the file to be installed does not exist.  
</para>
<para>The TARGETS signature:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  install(TARGETS targets... [EXPORT &lt;export-name&gt;]
          [[ARCHIVE|LIBRARY|RUNTIME|FRAMEWORK|BUNDLE|
            PRIVATE_HEADER|PUBLIC_HEADER|RESOURCE]
           [DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;]
           [PERMISSIONS permissions...]
           [CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]
           [COMPONENT &lt;component&gt;]
           [OPTIONAL] [NAMELINK_ONLY|NAMELINK_SKIP]
          ] [...])
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>The TARGETS form specifies rules for installing targets from a project.  There are five kinds of target files that may be installed: ARCHIVE, LIBRARY, RUNTIME, FRAMEWORK, and BUNDLE.  Executables are treated as RUNTIME targets, except that those marked with the MACOSX_BUNDLE property are treated as BUNDLE targets on OS X. Static libraries are always treated as ARCHIVE targets. Module libraries are always treated as LIBRARY targets. For non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as LIBRARY targets, except that those marked with the FRAMEWORK property are treated as FRAMEWORK targets on OS X.  For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is treated as a RUNTIME target and the corresponding import library is treated as an ARCHIVE target. All Windows-based systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms. The ARCHIVE, LIBRARY, RUNTIME, and FRAMEWORK arguments change the type of target to which the subsequent properties apply.  If none is given the installation properties apply to all target types.  If only one is given then only targets of that type will be installed (which can be used to install just a DLL or just an import library).
</para>
<para>The PRIVATE_HEADER, PUBLIC_HEADER, and RESOURCE arguments cause subsequent properties to be applied to installing a FRAMEWORK shared library target's associated files on non-Apple platforms.  Rules defined by these arguments are ignored on Apple platforms because the associated files are installed into the appropriate locations inside the framework folder.  See documentation of the PRIVATE_HEADER, PUBLIC_HEADER, and RESOURCE target properties for details.
</para>
<para>Either NAMELINK_ONLY or NAMELINK_SKIP may be specified as a LIBRARY option.  On some platforms a versioned shared library has a symbolic link such as
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  lib&lt;name&gt;.so -&gt; lib&lt;name&gt;.so.1
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>where "lib&lt;name&gt;.so.1" is the soname of the library and "lib&lt;name&gt;.so" is a "namelink" allowing linkers to find the library when given "-l&lt;name&gt;".  The NAMELINK_ONLY option causes installation of only the namelink when a library target is installed.  The NAMELINK_SKIP option causes installation of library files other than the namelink when a library target is installed.  When neither option is given both portions are installed.  On platforms where versioned shared libraries do not have namelinks or when a library is not versioned the NAMELINK_SKIP option installs the library and the NAMELINK_ONLY option installs nothing.  See the VERSION and SOVERSION target properties for details on creating versioned shared libraries.
</para>
<para>One or more groups of properties may be specified in a single call to the TARGETS form of this command.  A target may be installed more than once to different locations.  Consider hypothetical targets "myExe", "mySharedLib", and "myStaticLib".  The code
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>    install(TARGETS myExe mySharedLib myStaticLib
            RUNTIME DESTINATION bin
            LIBRARY DESTINATION lib
            ARCHIVE DESTINATION lib/static)
    install(TARGETS mySharedLib DESTINATION /some/full/path)
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>will install myExe to &lt;prefix&gt;/bin and myStaticLib to &lt;prefix&gt;/lib/static.  On non-DLL platforms mySharedLib will be installed to &lt;prefix&gt;/lib and /some/full/path.  On DLL platforms the mySharedLib DLL will be installed to &lt;prefix&gt;/bin and /some/full/path and its import library will be installed to &lt;prefix&gt;/lib/static and /some/full/path.
</para>
<para>The EXPORT option associates the installed target files with an export called &lt;export-name&gt;.  It must appear before any RUNTIME, LIBRARY, or ARCHIVE options.  To actually install the export file itself, call install(EXPORT).  See documentation of the install(EXPORT ...) signature below for details.
</para>
<para>Installing a target with EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL set to true has undefined behavior.
</para>
<para>The FILES signature:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  install(FILES files... DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;
          [PERMISSIONS permissions...]
          [CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]
          [COMPONENT &lt;component&gt;]
          [RENAME &lt;name&gt;] [OPTIONAL])
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>The FILES form specifies rules for installing files for a project.  File names given as relative paths are interpreted with respect to the current source directory.  Files installed by this form are by default given permissions OWNER_WRITE, OWNER_READ, GROUP_READ, and WORLD_READ if no PERMISSIONS argument is given.
</para>
<para>The PROGRAMS signature:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  install(PROGRAMS files... DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;
          [PERMISSIONS permissions...]
          [CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]
          [COMPONENT &lt;component&gt;]
          [RENAME &lt;name&gt;] [OPTIONAL])
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>The PROGRAMS form is identical to the FILES form except that the default permissions for the installed file also include OWNER_EXECUTE, GROUP_EXECUTE, and WORLD_EXECUTE.  This form is intended to install programs that are not targets, such as shell scripts.  Use the TARGETS form to install targets built within the project.
</para>
<para>The DIRECTORY signature:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  install(DIRECTORY dirs... DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;
          [FILE_PERMISSIONS permissions...]
          [DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS permissions...]
          [USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS] [OPTIONAL]
          [CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]
          [COMPONENT &lt;component&gt;] [FILES_MATCHING]
          [[PATTERN &lt;pattern&gt; | REGEX &lt;regex&gt;]
           [EXCLUDE] [PERMISSIONS permissions...]] [...])
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>The DIRECTORY form installs contents of one or more directories to a given destination.  The directory structure is copied verbatim to the destination.  The last component of each directory name is appended to the destination directory but a trailing slash may be used to avoid this because it leaves the last component empty.  Directory names given as relative paths are interpreted with respect to the current source directory.  If no input directory names are given the destination directory will be created but nothing will be installed into it.  The FILE_PERMISSIONS and DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS options specify permissions given to files and directories in the destination.  If USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS is specified and FILE_PERMISSIONS is not, file permissions will be copied from the source directory structure.  If no permissions are specified files will be given the default permissions specified in the FILES form of the command, and the directories will be given the default permissions specified in the PROGRAMS form of the command.
</para>
<para>Installation of directories may be controlled with fine granularity using the PATTERN or REGEX options.  These "match" options specify a globbing pattern or regular expression to match directories or files encountered within input directories.  They may be used to apply certain options (see below) to a subset of the files and directories encountered.  The full path to each input file or directory (with forward slashes) is matched against the expression.  A PATTERN will match only complete file names: the portion of the full path matching the pattern must occur at the end of the file name and be preceded by a slash.  A REGEX will match any portion of the full path but it may use '/' and '$' to simulate the PATTERN behavior.  By default all files and directories are installed whether or not they are matched.  The FILES_MATCHING option may be given before the first match option to disable installation of files (but not directories) not matched by any expression.  For example, the code
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  install(DIRECTORY src/ DESTINATION include/myproj
          FILES_MATCHING PATTERN "*.h")
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>will extract and install header files from a source tree.
</para>
<para>Some options may follow a PATTERN or REGEX expression and are applied only to files or directories matching them.  The EXCLUDE option will skip the matched file or directory.  The PERMISSIONS option overrides the permissions setting for the matched file or directory.  For example the code
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  install(DIRECTORY icons scripts/ DESTINATION share/myproj
          PATTERN "CVS" EXCLUDE
          PATTERN "scripts/*"
          PERMISSIONS OWNER_EXECUTE OWNER_WRITE OWNER_READ
                      GROUP_EXECUTE GROUP_READ)
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>will install the icons directory to share/myproj/icons and the scripts directory to share/myproj.  The icons will get default file permissions, the scripts will be given specific permissions, and any CVS directories will be excluded.
</para>
<para>The SCRIPT and CODE signature:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  install([[SCRIPT &lt;file&gt;] [CODE &lt;code&gt;]] [...])
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>The SCRIPT form will invoke the given CMake script files during installation.  If the script file name is a relative path it will be interpreted with respect to the current source directory.  The CODE form will invoke the given CMake code during installation.  Code is specified as a single argument inside a double-quoted string. For example, the code
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  install(CODE "MESSAGE(\"Sample install message.\")")
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>will print a message during installation.
</para>
<para>The EXPORT signature:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  install(EXPORT &lt;export-name&gt; DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;
          [NAMESPACE &lt;namespace&gt;] [FILE &lt;name&gt;.cmake]
          [PERMISSIONS permissions...]
          [CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]
          [COMPONENT &lt;component&gt;])
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>The EXPORT form generates and installs a CMake file containing code to import targets from the installation tree into another project.  Target installations are associated with the export &lt;export-name&gt; using the EXPORT option of the install(TARGETS ...) signature documented above.  The NAMESPACE option will prepend &lt;namespace&gt; to the target names as they are written to the import file.  By default the generated file will be called &lt;export-name&gt;.cmake but the FILE option may be used to specify a different name.  The value given to the FILE option must be a file name with the ".cmake" extension.  If a CONFIGURATIONS option is given then the file will only be installed when one of the named configurations is installed.  Additionally, the generated import file will reference only the matching target configurations.  If a COMPONENT option is specified that does not match that given to the targets associated with &lt;export-name&gt; the behavior is undefined.  If a library target is included in the export but a target to which it links is not included the behavior is unspecified.
</para>
<para>The EXPORT form is useful to help outside projects use targets built and installed by the current project.  For example, the code
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  install(TARGETS myexe EXPORT myproj DESTINATION bin)
  install(EXPORT myproj NAMESPACE mp_ DESTINATION lib/myproj)
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>will install the executable myexe to &lt;prefix&gt;/bin and code to import it in the file "&lt;prefix&gt;/lib/myproj/myproj.cmake".  An outside project may load this file with the include command and reference the myexe executable from the installation tree using the imported target name mp_myexe as if the target were built in its own tree.
</para>
<para>NOTE: This command supercedes the INSTALL_TARGETS command and the target properties PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT.  It also replaces the FILES forms of the INSTALL_FILES and INSTALL_PROGRAMS commands.  The processing order of these install rules relative to those generated by INSTALL_TARGETS, INSTALL_FILES, and INSTALL_PROGRAMS commands is not defined.

</para>
<para>The list subcommands APPEND, INSERT, REMOVE_AT, REMOVE_ITEM, REMOVE_DUPLICATES, REVERSE and SORT may create new values for the list within the current CMake variable scope. Similar to the SET command, the LIST command creates new variable values in the current scope, even if the list itself is actually defined in a parent scope. To propagate the results of these operations upwards, use SET with PARENT_SCOPE, SET with CACHE INTERNAL, or some other means of value propagation.
</para>
<para>NOTES: A list in cmake is a ; separated group of strings. To create a list the set command can be used. For example, set(var a b c d e)  creates a list with a;b;c;d;e, and set(var "a b c d e") creates a string or a list with one item in it.
</para>
<para>When specifying index values, if &lt;element index&gt; is 0 or greater, it is indexed from the beginning of the list, with 0 representing the first list element. If &lt;element index&gt; is -1 or lesser, it is indexed from the end of the list, with -1 representing the last list element. Be careful when counting with negative indices: they do not start from 0. -0 is equivalent to 0, the first list element.

</para>
<para>Define a macro named &lt;name&gt; that takes arguments named arg1 arg2 arg3 (...).  Commands listed after macro, but before the matching endmacro, are not invoked until the macro is invoked.  When it is invoked, the commands recorded in the macro are first modified by replacing formal parameters (${arg1}) with the arguments passed, and then invoked as normal commands. In addition to referencing the formal parameters you can reference the values ${ARGC} which will be set to the number of arguments passed into the function as well as ${ARGV0} ${ARGV1} ${ARGV2} ... which will have the actual values of the arguments passed in. This facilitates creating macros with optional arguments. Additionally ${ARGV} holds the list of all arguments given to the macro and ${ARGN} holds the list of arguments past the last expected argument. Note that the parameters to a macro and values such as ARGN are not variables in the usual CMake sense. They are string replacements much like the C preprocessor would do with a macro. If you want true CMake variables and/or better CMake scope control you should look at the function command.

</para>
<para>Within CMake sets &lt;variable&gt; to the value &lt;value&gt;.  &lt;value&gt; is expanded before &lt;variable&gt; is set to it.  Normally, set will set a regular CMake variable. If CACHE is present, then the &lt;variable&gt; is put in the cache instead, unless it is already in the cache. See section 'Variable types in CMake' below for details of regular and cache variables and their interactions. If CACHE is used, &lt;type&gt; and &lt;docstring&gt; are required. &lt;type&gt; is used by the CMake GUI to choose a widget with which the user sets a value. The value for &lt;type&gt; may be one of

  PATH     = Directory chooser dialog.

</programlisting>
</para>
<para>If &lt;type&gt; is INTERNAL, the cache variable is marked as internal, and will not be shown to the user in tools like cmake-gui. This is intended for values that should be persisted in the cache, but which users should not normally change. INTERNAL implies FORCE.
</para>
<para>Normally, set(...CACHE...) creates cache variables, but does not modify them. If FORCE is specified, the value of the cache variable is set, even if the variable is already in the cache. This should normally be avoided, as it will remove any changes to the cache variable's value by the user.
</para>
<para>If PARENT_SCOPE is present, the variable will be set in the scope above the current scope. Each new directory or function creates a new scope. This command will set the value of a variable into the parent directory or calling function (whichever is applicable to the case at hand). PARENT_SCOPE cannot be combined with CACHE.

<para>*** Variable types in CMake ***
</para>
<para>In CMake there are two types of variables: normal variables and cache variables. Normal variables are meant for the internal use of the script (just like variables in most programming languages); they are not persisted across CMake runs. Cache variables (unless set with INTERNAL) are mostly intended for configuration settings where the first CMake run determines a suitable default value, which the user can then override, by editing the cache with tools such as ccmake or cmake-gui. Cache variables are stored in the CMake cache file, and are persisted across CMake runs. 
</para>
<para>Both types can exist at the same time with the same name but different values. When ${FOO} is evaluated, CMake first looks for a normal variable 'FOO' in scope and uses it if set. If and only if no normal variable exists then it falls back to the cache variable 'FOO'.
</para>
<para>Some examples:
</para>
<para>The code 'set(FOO "x")' sets the normal variable 'FOO'. It does not touch the cache, but it will hide any existing cache value 'FOO'.
</para>
<para>The code 'set(FOO "x" CACHE ...)' checks for 'FOO' in the cache, ignoring any normal variable of the same name. If 'FOO' is in the cache then nothing happens to either the normal variable or the cache variable. If 'FOO' is not in the cache, then it is added to the cache.
</para>
<para>Finally, whenever a cache variable is added or modified by a command, CMake also *removes* the normal variable of the same name from the current scope so that an immediately following evaluation of it will expose the newly cached value.
</para>
<para>Normally projects should avoid using normal and cache variables of the same name, as this interaction can be hard to follow. However, in some situations it can be useful. One example (used by some projects):
</para>
<para>A project has a subproject in its source tree. The child project has its own CMakeLists.txt, which is included from the parent CMakeLists.txt using add_subdirectory(). Now, if the parent and the child project provide the same option (for example a compiler option), the parent gets the first chance to add a user-editable option to the cache. Normally, the child would then use the same value that the parent uses. However, it may be necessary to hard-code the value for the child project's option while still allowing the user to edit the value used by the parent project. The parent project can achieve this simply by setting a normal variable with the same name as the option in a scope sufficient to hide the option's cache variable from the child completely. The parent has already set the cache variable,  so the child's set(...CACHE...) will do nothing, and evaluating the option variable will use the value from the normal variable, which hides the cache variable.</para>

</para>
<para>Set properties on a target. The syntax for the command is to list all the files you want to change, and then provide the values you want to set next.  You can use any prop value pair you want and extract it later with the GET_TARGET_PROPERTY command.
</para>
<para>Properties that affect the name of a target's output file are as follows.  The PREFIX and SUFFIX properties override the default target name prefix (such as "lib") and suffix (such as ".so"). IMPORT_PREFIX and IMPORT_SUFFIX are the equivalent properties for the import library corresponding to a DLL (for SHARED library targets).  OUTPUT_NAME sets the real name of a target when it is built and can be used to help create two targets of the same name even though CMake requires unique logical target names.  There is also a &lt;CONFIG&gt;_OUTPUT_NAME that can set the output name on a per-configuration basis.  &lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX sets a postfix for the real name of the target when it is built under the configuration named by &lt;CONFIG&gt; (in upper-case, such as "DEBUG_POSTFIX").  The value of this property is initialized when the target is created to the value of the variable CMAKE_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX (except for executable targets because earlier CMake versions which did not use this variable for executables).
</para>
<para>The LINK_FLAGS property can be used to add extra flags to the link step of a target. LINK_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; will add to the configuration &lt;CONFIG&gt;, for example, DEBUG, RELEASE, MINSIZEREL, RELWITHDEBINFO. DEFINE_SYMBOL sets the name of the preprocessor symbol defined when compiling sources in a shared library. If not set here then it is set to target_EXPORTS by default (with some substitutions if the target is not a valid C identifier). This is useful for headers to know whether they are being included from inside their library or outside to properly setup dllexport/dllimport decorations. The COMPILE_FLAGS property sets additional compiler flags used to build sources within the target.  It may also be used to pass additional preprocessor definitions.
</para>
<para>The LINKER_LANGUAGE property is used to change the tool used to link an executable or shared library. The default is set the language to match the files in the library. CXX and C are common values for this property.
</para>
<para>For shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used to specify the build version and api version respectively. When building or installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports symlinks and the linker supports so-names. If only one of both is specified the missing is assumed to have the same version number. For executables VERSION can be used to specify the build version. When building or installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports symlinks. For shared libraries and executables on Windows the VERSION attribute is parsed to extract a "major.minor" version number. These numbers are used as the image version of the binary. 
</para>
<para>There are a few properties used to specify RPATH rules. INSTALL_RPATH is a semicolon-separated list specifying the rpath to use in installed targets (for platforms that support it). INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH is a boolean that if set to true will append directories in the linker search path and outside the project to the INSTALL_RPATH. SKIP_BUILD_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to skip automatic generation of an rpath allowing the target to run from the build tree. BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to link the target in the build tree with the INSTALL_RPATH.  This takes precedence over SKIP_BUILD_RPATH and avoids the need for relinking before installation.  INSTALL_NAME_DIR is a string specifying the directory portion of the "install_name" field of shared libraries on Mac OSX to use in the installed targets. When the target is created the values of the variables CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH, CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH, CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH, CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH, and CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR are used to initialize these properties.
</para>
<para>PROJECT_LABEL can be used to change the name of the target in an IDE like visual studio.  VS_KEYWORD can be set to change the visual studio keyword, for example Qt integration works better if this is set to Qt4VSv1.0.
</para>
<para>VS_SCC_PROJECTNAME, VS_SCC_LOCALPATH, VS_SCC_PROVIDER and VS_SCC_AUXPATH can be set to add support for source control bindings in a  Visual Studio project file.
</para>
<para>VS_GLOBAL_&lt;variable&gt; can be set to add a Visual Studio project-specific global variable. Qt integration works better if VS_GLOBAL_QtVersion is set to the Qt version FindQt4.cmake found. For example, "4.7.3"
</para>
<para>The PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT properties are the old way to specify CMake scripts to run before and after installing a target.  They are used only when the old INSTALL_TARGETS command is used to install the target.  Use the INSTALL command instead.
</para>
<para>The EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD property is used by the visual studio generators.  If it is set to 1 the target will not be part of the default build when you select "Build Solution". This can also be set on a per-configuration basis using EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD_&lt;CONFIG&gt;.</para>

</para>
<para>If a library name matches that of another target in the project a dependency will automatically be added in the build system to make sure the library being linked is up-to-date before the target links.  Item names starting with '-', but not '-l' or '-framework', are treated as linker flags.
</para>
<para>A "debug", "optimized", or "general" keyword indicates that the library immediately following it is to be used only for the corresponding build configuration.  The "debug" keyword corresponds to the Debug configuration (or to configurations named in the DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS global property if it is set).  The "optimized" keyword corresponds to all other configurations.  The "general" keyword corresponds to all configurations, and is purely optional (assumed if omitted).  Higher granularity may be achieved for per-configuration rules by creating and linking to IMPORTED library targets.  See the IMPORTED mode of the add_library command for more information.  
</para>
<para>Library dependencies are transitive by default.  When this target is linked into another target then the libraries linked to this target will appear on the link line for the other target too.  See the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES target property to override the set of transitive link dependencies for a target.

<para>The library dependency graph is normally acyclic (a DAG), but in the case of mutually-dependent STATIC libraries CMake allows the graph to contain cycles (strongly connected components).

If the executable was built, but failed to run, then RUN_RESULT_VAR will be set to FAILED_TO_RUN. COMPILE_OUTPUT_VARIABLE specifies the variable where the output from the compile step goes. RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE specifies the variable where the output from the running executable goes.
</para>
<para>For compatibility reasons OUTPUT_VARIABLE is still supported, which gives you the output from the compile and run step combined.
</para>
<para>Cross compiling issues
</para>
<para>When cross compiling, the executable compiled in the first step usually cannot be run on the build host. try_run() checks the CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING variable to detect whether CMake is in crosscompiling mode. If that's the case, it will still try to compile the executable, but it will not try to run the executable. Instead it will create cache variables which must be filled by the user or by presetting them in some CMake script file to the values the executable would have produced if it had been run on its actual target platform. These variables are RUN_RESULT_VAR (explanation see above) and if RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE (or OUTPUT_VARIABLE) was used, an additional cache variable RUN_RESULT_VAR__COMPILE_RESULT_VAR__TRYRUN_OUTPUT.This is intended to hold stdout and stderr from the executable.
</para>
<para>In order to make cross compiling your project easier, use try_run only if really required. If you use try_run, use RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE (or OUTPUT_VARIABLE) only if really required. Using them will require that when crosscompiling, the cache variables will have to be set manually to the output of the executable. You can also "guard" the calls to try_run with if(CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING) and provide an easy-to-preset alternative for this case.

<para>Allow duplicate custom targets to be created.</para>
</abstract>
<para>Normally CMake requires that all targets built in a project have globally unique logical names (see policy CMP0002).  This is necessary to generate meaningful project file names in Xcode and VS IDE generators.  It also allows the target names to be referenced unambiguously.
</para>
<para>Makefile generators are capable of supporting duplicate custom target names.  For projects that care only about Makefile generators and do not wish to support Xcode or VS IDE generators, one may set this property to true to allow duplicate custom targets.  The property allows multiple add_custom_target command calls in different directories to specify the same target name.  However, setting this property will cause non-Makefile generators to produce an error and refuse to generate the project.</para>

</abstract>
<para>The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to a semicolon-separated list of preprocessor definitions using the syntax VAR or VAR=value.  Function-style definitions are not supported.  CMake will automatically escape the value correctly for the native build system (note that CMake language syntax may require escapes to specify some values).  This property may be set on a per-configuration basis using the name COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; where &lt;CONFIG&gt; is an upper-case name (ex. "COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG").  This property will be initialized in each directory by its value in the directory's parent.
</para>
<para>CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported by the native build tool.  The VS6 IDE does not support definition values with spaces (but NMake does).
</para>
<para>Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping certain values.  CMake has work-arounds for many cases but some values may just not be possible to pass correctly.  If a value does not seem to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work-around the problem by adding escape sequences to the value.  Your work-around may break in a future version of CMake that has improved escape support.  Instead consider defining the macro in a (configured) header file.  Then report the limitation.  Known limitations include:

<abstract>
<para>Should the target be processed with automoc (for Qt projects).</para>
</abstract>
<para>AUTOMOC is a boolean specifying whether CMake will handle the Qt moc preprocessor automatically, i.e. without having to use the QT4_WRAP_CPP() or QT5_WRAP_CPP() macro. Currently Qt4 and Qt5 are supported.  When this property is set to TRUE, CMake will scan the source files at build time and invoke moc accordingly. If an #include statement like #include "moc_foo.cpp" is found, the Q_OBJECT class declaration is expected in the header, and moc is run on the header file. If an #include statement like #include "foo.moc" is found, then a Q_OBJECT is expected in the current source file and moc is run on the file itself. Additionally, all header files are parsed for Q_OBJECT macros, and if found, moc is also executed on those files. The resulting moc files, which are not included as shown above in any of the source files are included in a generated &lt;targetname&gt;_automoc.cpp file, which is compiled as part of the target.This property is initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_AUTOMOC if it is set when a target is created.

<para>Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping certain values.  CMake has work-arounds for many cases but some values may just not be possible to pass correctly.  If a value does not seem to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work-around the problem by adding escape sequences to the value.  Your work-around may break in a future version of CMake that has improved escape support.  Instead consider defining the macro in a (configured) header file.  Then report the limitation.  Known limitations include:

<para>Normally an executable does not export any symbols because it is the final program.  It is possible for an executable to export symbols to be used by loadable modules.  When this property is set to true CMake will allow other targets to "link" to the executable with the TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES command.  On all platforms a target-level dependency on the executable is created for targets that link to it.  For DLL platforms an import library will be created for the exported symbols and then used for linking.  All Windows-based systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms.  For non-DLL platforms that require all symbols to be resolved at link time, such as Mac OS X, the module will "link" to the executable using a flag like "-bundle_loader".  For other non-DLL platforms the link rule is simply ignored since the dynamic loader will automatically bind symbols when the module is loaded.  </para>

<para>This property specifies the list of directories given so far to the include_directories command. This property exists on directories and targets. In addition to accepting values from the include_directories command, values may be set directly on any directory or any target using the set_property command. A target gets its initial value for this property from the value of the directory property. A directory gets its initial value from its parent directory if it has one. Both directory and target property values are adjusted by calls to the include_directories command.

<para>Repetition count for STATIC libraries with cyclic dependencies.</para>
</abstract>
<para>When linking to a STATIC library target with cyclic dependencies the linker may need to scan more than once through the archives in the strongly connected component of the dependency graph.  CMake by default constructs the link line so that the linker will scan through the component at least twice.  This property specifies the minimum number of scans if it is larger than the default.  CMake uses the largest value specified by any target in a component.</para>

<sect2 id="cmake.prop_tgt.LINK_LIBRARIES">
<title>LINK_LIBRARIES</title>
<abstract>
<para>List of direct link dependencies.</para>
</abstract>
<para>This property specifies the list of libraries or targets which will be used for linking. In addition to accepting values from the target_link_libraries command, values may be set directly on any target using the set_property command. 
</para>
<para>The target property values are used by the generators to set the link libraries for the compiler.  See also the target_link_libraries command.
</para>
<para>Contents of LINK_LIBRARIES may use "generator expressions" with the syntax "$&lt;...&gt;".  Generator expressions are evaluted during build system generation to produce information specific to each build configuration.  Valid expressions are:

  $&lt;TARGET_NAME:...&gt;        = Marks ... as being the name of a target.  This is required if exporting targets to multiple dependent export sets.  The '...' must be a literal name of a target- it may not contain generator expressions.

<abstract>
<para>End a link line such that static system libraries are used.</para>
</abstract>
<para>Some linkers support switches such as -Bstatic and -Bdynamic to determine whether to use static or shared libraries for -lXXX options.  CMake uses these options to set the link type for libraries whose full paths are not known or (in some cases) are in implicit link directories for the platform.  By default CMake adds an option at the end of the library list (if necessary) to set the linker search type back to its starting type.  This property switches the final linker search type to -Bstatic regardless of how it started.  See also LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC.</para>

<para>Some linkers support switches such as -Bstatic and -Bdynamic to determine whether to use static or shared libraries for -lXXX options.  CMake uses these options to set the link type for libraries whose full paths are not known or (in some cases) are in implicit link directories for the platform.  By default the linker search type is assumed to be -Bdynamic at the beginning of the library list.  This property switches the assumption to -Bstatic.

<para>For an imported target, this read-only property returns the value of the LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt; property for an unspecified configuration &lt;CONFIG&gt; provided by the target.
</para>
<para>For a non-imported target, this property is provided for compatibility with CMake 2.4 and below.  It was meant to get the location of an executable target's output file for use in add_custom_command.  The path may contain a build-system-specific portion that is replaced at build time with the configuration getting built (such as "$(ConfigurationName)" in VS). In CMake 2.6 and above add_custom_command automatically recognizes a target name in its COMMAND and DEPENDS options and computes the target location.  In CMake 2.8.4 and above add_custom_command recognizes generator expressions to refer to target locations anywhere in the command.  Therefore this property is not needed for creating custom commands.
</para>
<para>Do not set properties that affect the location of a target after reading this property.  These include properties whose names match "(RUNTIME|LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_&lt;CONFIG&gt;)?", "(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|SUFFIX)", or "LINKER_LANGUAGE".  Failure to follow this rule is not diagnosed and leaves the location of the target undefined.</para>

Default is to set "soname" on all shared libraries and modules as long as the platform supports it. Generally, use this property only for leaf private libraries or plugins. If you use it on normal shared libraries which other targets link against, on some platforms a linker will insert a full path to the library (as specified at link time) into the dynamic section of the dependent binary.

<sect2 id="cmake.prop_sf.COMPILE_DEFINITIONS">
<title>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</title>
<abstract>
<para>Preprocessor definitions for compiling a source file.</para>
</abstract>
<para>The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to a semicolon-separated list of preprocessor definitions using the syntax VAR or VAR=value.  Function-style definitions are not supported.  CMake will automatically escape the value correctly for the native build system (note that CMake language syntax may require escapes to specify some values).  This property may be set on a per-configuration basis using the name COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; where &lt;CONFIG&gt; is an upper-case name (ex. "COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG").
</para>
<para>CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported by the native build tool.  The VS6 IDE does not support definition values with spaces (but NMake does).  Xcode does not support per-configuration definitions on source files.
</para>
<para>Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping certain values.  CMake has work-arounds for many cases but some values may just not be possible to pass correctly.  If a value does not seem to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work-around the problem by adding escape sequences to the value.  Your work-around may break in a future version of CMake that has improved escape support.  Instead consider defining the macro in a (configured) header file.  Then report the limitation.  Known limitations include:
</para>
<para>

</para>
<para>This property need not be used to specify the dependency of a source file on a generated header file that it includes.  Although the property was originally introduced for this purpose, it is no longer necessary.  If the generated header file is created by a custom command in the same target as the source file, the automatic dependency scanning process will recognize the dependency.  If the generated header file is created by another target, an inter-target dependency should be created with the add_dependencies command (if one does not already exist due to linking relationships).</para>

<para>Add a list of subdirectories to the build. The add_subdirectory command should be used instead of subdirs although subdirs will still work. This will cause any CMakeLists.txt files in the sub directories to be processed by CMake.  Any directories after the PREORDER flag are traversed first by makefile builds, the PREORDER flag has no effect on IDE projects.  Any directories after the EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL marker will not be included in the top level makefile or project file. This is useful for having CMake create makefiles or projects for a set of examples in a project. You would want CMake to generate makefiles or project files for all the examples at the same time, but you would not want them to show up in the top level project or be built each time make is run from the top.</para>

<para>When a third-party utility's source is included in the distribution, this command specifies its location and name.

</para>
<para>When cross compiling CMake will print a warning if a utility_source() command is executed, because in many cases it is used to build an executable which is executed later on. This doesn't work when cross compiling, since the executable can run only on their target platform. So in this case the cache entry has to be adjusted manually so it points to an executable which is runnable on the build host.</para>

</para>
<para>This function requires that the resolved_embedded_item be "inside" the bundle already. In other words, if you pass plugins to fixup_bundle as the libs parameter, you should install them or copy them into the bundle before calling fixup_bundle. The "libs" parameter is a list of libraries that must be fixed up, but that cannot be determined by otool output analysis. (i.e., plugins)

<para>Use MinGW gfortran from VS if a fortran compiler is not found.</para>
</abstract>
<para>The 'add_fortran_subdirectory' function adds a subdirectory to a project that contains a fortran only sub-project. The module will check the current compiler and see if it can support fortran. If no fortran compiler is found and the compiler is MSVC, then this module will find the MinGW gfortran.  It will then use an external project to build with the MinGW tools.  It will also create imported targets for the libraries created.  This will only work if the fortran code is built into a dll, so BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is turned on in the project.  In addition the CMAKE_GNUtoMS option is set to on, so that the MS .lib files are created. Usage is as follows:
</para>
<para>

<para>CONFIGURE_PACKAGE_CONFIG_FILE() should be used instead of the plain configure_file() command when creating the &lt;Name&gt;Config.cmake or &lt;Name&gt;-config.cmake file for installing a project or library. It helps making the resulting package relocatable by avoiding hardcoded paths in the installed Config.cmake file.
</para>
<para>In a FooConfig.cmake file there may be code like this to make the install destinations know to the using project:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   set(FOO_INCLUDE_DIR   "@CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_INCLUDEDIR@" )
   set(FOO_DATA_DIR   "@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/@RELATIVE_DATA_INSTALL_DIR@" )
   set(FOO_ICONS_DIR   "@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/share/icons" )
   ...logic to determine installedPrefix from the own location...
   set(FOO_CONFIG_DIR  "${installedPrefix}/@CONFIG_INSTALL_DIR@" )
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>All 4 options shown above are not sufficient, since the first 3 hardcode the absolute directory locations, and the 4th case works only if the logic to determine the installedPrefix is correct, and if CONFIG_INSTALL_DIR contains a relative path, which in general cannot be guaranteed. This has the effect that the resulting FooConfig.cmake file would work poorly under Windows and OSX, where users are used to choose the install location of a binary package at install time, independent from how CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX was set at build/cmake time.
</para>
<para>Using CONFIGURE_PACKAGE_CONFIG_FILE() helps. If used correctly, it makes the resulting FooConfig.cmake file relocatable. Usage:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   1. write a FooConfig.cmake.in file as you are used to
   2. insert a line containing only the string "@PACKAGE_INIT@"
   3. instead of set(FOO_DIR "@SOME_INSTALL_DIR@"), use set(FOO_DIR "@PACKAGE_SOME_INSTALL_DIR@")
      (this must be after the @PACKAGE_INIT@ line)
   4. instead of using the normal configure_file(), use CONFIGURE_PACKAGE_CONFIG_FILE()
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>The &lt;input&gt; and &lt;output&gt; arguments are the input and output file, the same way as in configure_file().
</para>
<para>The &lt;path&gt; given to INSTALL_DESTINATION must be the destination where the FooConfig.cmake file will be installed to. This can either be a relative or absolute path, both work.
</para>
<para>The variables &lt;var1&gt; to &lt;varN&gt; given as PATH_VARS are the variables which contain install destinations. For each of them the macro will create a helper variable PACKAGE_&lt;var...&gt;. These helper variables must be used in the FooConfig.cmake.in file for setting the installed location. They are calculated by CONFIGURE_PACKAGE_CONFIG_FILE() so that they are always relative to the installed location of the package. This works both for relative and also for absolute locations. For absolute locations it works only if the absolute location is a subdirectory of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.
</para>
<para>By default configure_package_config_file() also generates two helper macros, set_and_check() and check_required_components() into the FooConfig.cmake file.
</para>
<para>set_and_check() should be used instead of the normal set() command for setting directories and file locations. Additionally to setting the variable it also checks that the referenced file or directory actually exists and fails with a FATAL_ERROR otherwise. This makes sure that the created FooConfig.cmake file does not contain wrong references. When using the NO_SET_AND_CHECK_MACRO, this macro is not generated into the FooConfig.cmake file.
</para>
<para>check_required_components(&lt;package_name&gt;) should be called at the end of the FooConfig.cmake file if the package supports components. This macro checks whether all requested, non-optional components have been found, and if this is not the case, sets the Foo_FOUND variable to FALSE, so that the package is considered to be not found. It does that by testing the Foo_&lt;Component&gt;_FOUND variables for all requested required components. When using the NO_CHECK_REQUIRED_COMPONENTS option, this macro is not generated into the FooConfig.cmake file.
</para>
<para>For an example see below the documentation for WRITE_BASIC_PACKAGE_VERSION_FILE().
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  WRITE_BASIC_PACKAGE_VERSION_FILE( filename VERSION major.minor.patch COMPATIBILITY (AnyNewerVersion|SameMajorVersion|ExactVersion) )
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>Writes a file for use as &lt;package&gt;ConfigVersion.cmake file to &lt;filename&gt;. See the documentation of find_package() for details on this.
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>    filename is the output filename, it should be in the build tree.
    major.minor.patch is the version number of the project to be installed
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>The COMPATIBILITY mode AnyNewerVersion means that the installed package version will be considered compatible if it is newer or exactly the same as the requested version. This mode should be used for packages which are fully backward compatible, also across major versions. If SameMajorVersion is used instead, then the behaviour differs from AnyNewerVersion in that the major version number must be the same as requested, e.g. version 2.0 will not be considered compatible if 1.0 is requested. This mode should be used for packages which guarantee backward compatibility within the same major version. If ExactVersion is used, then the package is only considered compatible if the requested version matches exactly its own version number (not considering the tweak version). For example, version 1.2.3 of a package is only considered compatible to requested version 1.2.3. This mode is for packages without compatibility guarantees. If your project has more elaborated version matching rules, you will need to write your own custom ConfigVersion.cmake file instead of using this macro.
</para>
<para>Internally, this macro executes configure_file() to create the resulting version file. Depending on the COMPATIBLITY, either the file BasicConfigVersion-SameMajorVersion.cmake.in or BasicConfigVersion-AnyNewerVersion.cmake.in is used. Please note that these two files are internal to CMake and you should not call configure_file() on them yourself, but they can be used as starting point to create more sophisticted custom ConfigVersion.cmake files.

<para>CMAKE_PARSE_ARGUMENTS(&lt;prefix&gt; &lt;options&gt; &lt;one_value_keywords&gt; &lt;multi_value_keywords&gt; args...)
</para>
<para>CMAKE_PARSE_ARGUMENTS() is intended to be used in macros or functions for parsing the arguments given to that macro or function. It processes the arguments and defines a set of variables which hold the values of the respective options.
</para>
<para>The &lt;options&gt; argument contains all options for the respective macro, i.e. keywords which can be used when calling the macro without any value following, like e.g. the OPTIONAL keyword of the install() command.
</para>
<para>The &lt;one_value_keywords&gt; argument contains all keywords for this macro which are followed by one value, like e.g. DESTINATION keyword of the install() command.
</para>
<para>The &lt;multi_value_keywords&gt; argument contains all keywords for this macro which can be followed by more than one value, like e.g. the TARGETS or FILES keywords of the install() command.
</para>
<para>When done, CMAKE_PARSE_ARGUMENTS() will have defined for each of the keywords listed in &lt;options&gt;, &lt;one_value_keywords&gt; and &lt;multi_value_keywords&gt; a variable composed of the given &lt;prefix&gt; followed by "_" and the name of the respective keyword. These variables will then hold the respective value from the argument list. For the &lt;options&gt; keywords this will be TRUE or FALSE.
</para>
<para>All remaining arguments are collected in a variable &lt;prefix&gt;_UNPARSED_ARGUMENTS, this can be checked afterwards to see whether your macro was called with unrecognized parameters.
</para>
<para>As an example here a my_install() macro, which takes similar arguments as the real install() command:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   function(MY_INSTALL)
     set(options OPTIONAL FAST)
     set(oneValueArgs DESTINATION RENAME)
     set(multiValueArgs TARGETS CONFIGURATIONS)
     cmake_parse_arguments(MY_INSTALL "${options}" "${oneValueArgs}" "${multiValueArgs}" ${ARGN} )

</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   my_install(TARGETS foo bar DESTINATION bin OPTIONAL blub)
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>After the cmake_parse_arguments() call the macro will have set the following variables:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   MY_INSTALL_OPTIONAL = TRUE
   MY_INSTALL_FAST = FALSE (this option was not used when calling my_install()
   MY_INSTALL_DESTINATION = "bin"
   MY_INSTALL_RENAME = "" (was not used)
   MY_INSTALL_TARGETS = "foo;bar"
   MY_INSTALL_CONFIGURATIONS = "" (was not used)
   MY_INSTALL_UNPARSED_ARGUMENTS = "blub" (no value expected after "OPTIONAL"
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>You can the continue and process these variables.
</para>
<para>Keywords terminate lists of values, e.g. if directly after a one_value_keyword another recognized keyword follows, this is interpreted as the beginning of the new option. E.g. my_install(TARGETS foo DESTINATION OPTIONAL) would result in MY_INSTALL_DESTINATION set to "OPTIONAL", but MY_INSTALL_DESTINATION would be empty and MY_INSTALL_OPTIONAL would be set to TRUE therefor.</para>

<abstract>
<para>Build binary and source package installers.</para>
</abstract>
<para>The CPack module generates binary and source installers in a variety of formats using the cpack program. Inclusion of the CPack module adds two new targets to the resulting makefiles, package and package_source, which build the binary and source installers, respectively. The generated binary installers contain everything installed via CMake's INSTALL command (and the deprecated INSTALL_FILES, INSTALL_PROGRAMS, and INSTALL_TARGETS commands).
</para>
<para>For certain kinds of binary installers (including the graphical installers on Mac OS X and Windows), CPack generates installers that allow users to select individual application components to install. See CPackComponent module for that.
</para>
<para>The CPACK_GENERATOR variable has different meanings in different contexts. In your CMakeLists.txt file, CPACK_GENERATOR is a *list of generators*: when run with no other arguments, CPack will iterate over that list and produce one package for each generator. In a CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE, though, CPACK_GENERATOR is a *string naming a single generator*. If you need per-cpack- generator logic to control *other* cpack settings, then you need a CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE.
</para>
<para>The CMake source tree itself contains a CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE. See the top level file CMakeCPackOptions.cmake.in for an example.
</para>
<para>If set, the CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE is included automatically on a per-generator basis. It only need contain overrides.
</para>
<para>Here's how it works:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  - cpack runs
  - it includes CPackConfig.cmake
  - it iterates over the generators listed in that file's
    CPACK_GENERATOR list variable (unless told to use just a
    specific one via -G on the command line...)
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  - foreach generator, it then
    - sets CPACK_GENERATOR to the one currently being iterated
    - includes the CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE
    - produces the package for that generator
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>This is the key: For each generator listed in CPACK_GENERATOR in CPackConfig.cmake, cpack will *reset* CPACK_GENERATOR internally to *the one currently being used* and then include the CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE.
</para>
<para>Before including this CPack module in your CMakeLists.txt file, there are a variety of variables that can be set to customize the resulting installers. The most commonly-used variables are:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME - The name of the package (or application). If
  not specified, defaults to the project name.
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  CPACK_PACKAGE_VENDOR - The name of the package vendor. (e.g.,
  "Kitware").
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  CPACK_PACKAGE_DIRECTORY - The directory in which CPack is doing its
  packaging. If it is not set then this will default (internally) to the
  build dir. This variable may be defined in CPack config file or from
  the cpack command line option "-B". If set the command line option
  override the value found in the config file.
</programlisting>
</para>

</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  CPACK_PACKAGE_INSTALL_DIRECTORY - Installation directory on the
  target system. This may be used by some CPack generators
  like NSIS to create an installation directory e.g., "CMake 2.5"
  below the installation prefix. All installed element will be
  put inside this directory.
</programlisting>
</para>

<programlisting>   CPACK_PACKAGE_ICON - A branding image that will be displayed inside
   the installer (used by GUI installers).
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE - CPack-time project CPack configuration
  file. This file included at cpack time, once per
  generator after CPack has set CPACK_GENERATOR to the actual generator
  being used. It allows per-generator setting of CPACK_* variables at
  cpack time.
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE - License to be embedded in the installer. It
  will typically be displayed to the user by the produced installer
  (often with an explicit "Accept" button, for graphical installers)
  prior to installation. This license file is NOT added to installed
  file but is used by some CPack generators like NSIS. If you want
  to install a license file (may be the same as this one)
  along with your project you must add an appropriate CMake INSTALL
  command in your CMakeLists.txt.
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_README - ReadMe file to be embedded in the installer. It
  typically describes in some detail the purpose of the project
  during the installation. Not all CPack generators uses
  this file.
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_WELCOME - Welcome file to be embedded in the
  installer. It welcomes users to this installer.
  Typically used in the graphical installers on Windows and Mac OS X.
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  CPACK_MONOLITHIC_INSTALL - Disables the component-based
  installation mechanism. When set the component specification is ignored
  and all installed items are put in a single "MONOLITHIC" package.
  Some CPack generators do monolithic packaging by default and
  may be asked to do component packaging by setting
  CPACK_&lt;GENNAME&gt;_COMPONENT_INSTALL to 1/TRUE.
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  CPACK_GENERATOR - List of CPack generators to use. If not
  specified, CPack will create a set of options CPACK_BINARY_&lt;GENNAME&gt; (e.g.,
  CPACK_BINARY_NSIS) allowing the user to enable/disable individual
  generators. This variable may be used on the command line
  as well as in:
</programlisting>

  file. This file is the CPack configuration generated by the CPack module
  for binary installers. Defaults to CPackConfig.cmake.
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  CPACK_PACKAGE_EXECUTABLES - Lists each of the executables and associated
  text label to be used to create Start Menu shortcuts. For example,
  setting this to the list ccmake;CMake will
  create a shortcut named "CMake" that will execute the installed
  executable ccmake. Not all CPack generators use it (at least NSIS and
  OSXX11 do).
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  CPACK_STRIP_FILES - List of files to be stripped. Starting with
  CMake 2.6.0 CPACK_STRIP_FILES will be a boolean variable which
  enables stripping of all files (a list of files evaluates to TRUE
  in CMake, so this change is compatible).
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>The following CPack variables are specific to source packages, and will not affect binary packages:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  CPACK_SOURCE_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME - The name of the source package. For
  example cmake-2.6.1.
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>

  stripping of all files (a list of files evaluates to TRUE in CMake,
  so this change is compatible).
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  CPACK_SOURCE_GENERATOR - List of generators used for the source
  packages. As with CPACK_GENERATOR, if this is not specified then

<programlisting>  CPACK_SOURCE_OUTPUT_CONFIG_FILE - The name of the CPack source
  configuration file. This file is the CPack configuration generated by the
  CPack module for source installers. Defaults to CPackSourceConfig.cmake.
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  CPACK_SOURCE_IGNORE_FILES - Pattern of files in the source tree
  that won't be packaged when building a source package. This is a

<para>The CPackComponent module is the module which handles the component part of CPack. See CPack module for general information about CPack.
</para>
<para>For certain kinds of binary installers (including the graphical installers on Mac OS X and Windows), CPack generates installers that allow users to select individual application components to install. The contents of each of the components are identified by the COMPONENT argument of CMake's INSTALL command. These components can be annotated with user-friendly names and descriptions, inter-component dependencies, etc., and grouped in various ways to customize the resulting installer. See the cpack_add_* commands, described below, for more information about component-specific installations.
</para>
<para>Component-specific installation allows users to select specific sets of components to install during the install process. Installation components are identified by the COMPONENT argument of CMake's INSTALL commands, and should be further described by the following CPack commands:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  CPACK_COMPONENTS_ALL - The list of component to install.
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>The default value of this variable is computed by CPack and contains all components defined by the project. The user may set it to only include the specified components.
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  CPACK_&lt;GENNAME&gt;_COMPONENT_INSTALL - Enable/Disable component install for
  CPack generator &lt;GENNAME&gt;.
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>Each CPack Generator (RPM, DEB, ARCHIVE, NSIS, DMG, etc...) has a legacy default behavior. e.g. RPM builds monolithic whereas NSIS builds component. One can change the default behavior by setting this variable to 0/1 or OFF/ON.
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  CPACK_COMPONENTS_GROUPING - Specify how components are grouped for multi-package
  component-aware CPack generators.
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>Some generators like RPM or ARCHIVE family (TGZ, ZIP, ...) generates several packages files when asked for component packaging. They group the component differently depending on the value of this variable:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  - ONE_PER_GROUP (default): creates one package file per component group
  - ALL_COMPONENTS_IN_ONE : creates a single package with all (requested) component
  - IGNORE : creates one package per component, i.e. IGNORE component group

</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>The cmake_add_component command describes an installation component, which the user can opt to install or remove as part of the graphical installation process. compname is the name of the component, as provided to the COMPONENT argument of one or more CMake INSTALL commands.
</para>
<para>DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the component, used in graphical installers to display the component name. This value can be any string.
</para>
<para>DESCRIPTION is an extended description of the component, used in graphical installers to give the user additional information about the component. Descriptions can span multiple lines using "\n" as the line separator. Typically, these descriptions should be no more than a few lines long.
</para>
<para>HIDDEN indicates that this component will be hidden in the graphical installer, so that the user cannot directly change whether it is installed or not.
</para>
<para>REQUIRED indicates that this component is required, and therefore will always be installed. It will be visible in the graphical installer, but it cannot be unselected. (Typically, required components are shown greyed out).
</para>
<para>DISABLED indicates that this component should be disabled (unselected) by default. The user is free to select this component for installation, unless it is also HIDDEN.
</para>
<para>DEPENDS lists the components on which this component depends. If this component is selected, then each of the components listed must also be selected. The dependency information is encoded within the installer itself, so that users cannot install inconsistent sets of components.
</para>
<para>GROUP names the component group of which this component is a part. If not provided, the component will be a standalone component, not part of any component group. Component groups are described with the cpack_add_component_group command, detailed below.
</para>
<para>INSTALL_TYPES lists the installation types of which this component is a part. When one of these installations types is selected, this component will automatically be selected. Installation types are described with the cpack_add_install_type command, detailed below.
</para>
<para>DOWNLOADED indicates that this component should be downloaded on-the-fly by the installer, rather than packaged in with the installer itself. For more information, see the cpack_configure_downloads command.
</para>
<para>ARCHIVE_FILE provides a name for the archive file created by CPack to be used for downloaded components. If not supplied, CPack will create a file with some name based on CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME and the name of the component. See cpack_configure_downloads for more information.

</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>The cpack_add_component_group describes a group of installation components, which will be placed together within the listing of options. Typically, component groups allow the user to select/deselect all of the components within a single group via a single group-level option. Use component groups to reduce the complexity of installers with many options. groupname is an arbitrary name used to identify the group in the GROUP argument of the cpack_add_component command, which is used to place a component in a group. The name of the group must not conflict with the name of any component.
</para>
<para>DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the component group, used in graphical installers to display the component group name. This value can be any string.
</para>
<para>DESCRIPTION is an extended description of the component group, used in graphical installers to give the user additional information about the components within that group. Descriptions can span multiple lines using "\n" as the line separator. Typically, these descriptions should be no more than a few lines long.
</para>
<para>PARENT_GROUP, if supplied, names the parent group of this group. Parent groups are used to establish a hierarchy of groups, providing an arbitrary hierarchy of groups.
</para>
<para>EXPANDED indicates that, by default, the group should show up as "expanded", so that the user immediately sees all of the components within the group. Otherwise, the group will initially show up as a single entry.
</para>
<para>BOLD_TITLE indicates that the group title should appear in bold, to call the user's attention to the group.

<para>The cpack_add_install_type command identifies a set of preselected components that represents a common use case for an application. For example, a "Developer" install type might include an application along with its header and library files, while an "End user" install type might just include the application's executable. Each component identifies itself with one or more install types via the INSTALL_TYPES argument to cpack_add_component.
</para>
<para>DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the install type, which will typically show up in a drop-down box within a graphical installer. This value can be any string.

<para>
</para>
<para>The cpack_configure_downloads command configures installation-time downloads of selected components. For each downloadable component, CPack will create an archive containing the contents of that component, which should be uploaded to the given site. When the user selects that component for installation, the installer will download and extract the component in place. This feature is useful for creating small installers that only download the requested components, saving bandwidth. Additionally, the installers are small enough that they will be installed as part of the normal installation process, and the "Change" button in Windows Add/Remove Programs control panel will allow one to add or remove parts of the application after the original installation. On Windows, the downloaded-components functionality requires the ZipDLL plug-in for NSIS, available at:

<para>
</para>
<para>On Mac OS X, installers that download components on-the-fly can only be built and installed on system using Mac OS X 10.5 or later.
</para>
<para>The site argument is a URL where the archives for downloadable components will reside, e.g., <ulink url="http://www.cmake.org/files/2.6.1/installer/" /> All of the archives produced by CPack should be uploaded to that location.
</para>
<para>UPLOAD_DIRECTORY is the local directory where CPack will create the various archives for each of the components. The contents of this directory should be uploaded to a location accessible by the URL given in the site argument. If omitted, CPack will use the directory CPackUploads inside the CMake binary directory to store the generated archives.
</para>
<para>The ALL flag indicates that all components be downloaded. Otherwise, only those components explicitly marked as DOWNLOADED or that have a specified ARCHIVE_FILE will be downloaded. Additionally, the ALL option implies ADD_REMOVE (unless NO_ADD_REMOVE is specified).
</para>
<para>ADD_REMOVE indicates that CPack should install a copy of the installer that can be called from Windows' Add/Remove Programs dialog (via the "Modify" button) to change the set of installed components. NO_ADD_REMOVE turns off this behavior. This option is ignored on Mac OS X.</para>

</para>
<para>However as a handy reminder here comes the list of specific variables:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_SUMMARY - The RPM package summary.
     Mandatory : YES
     Default   : CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_SUMMARY
  CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_NAME - The RPM package name.
     Mandatory : YES
     Default   : CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME
  CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_VERSION - The RPM package version.
     Mandatory : YES
     Default   : CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION
  CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_ARCHITECTURE - The RPM package architecture.
     Mandatory : NO
     Default   : -
     This may be set to "noarch" if you
     know you are building a noarch package.
  CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_RELEASE - The RPM package release.
     Mandatory : YES
     Default   : 1
     This is the numbering of the RPM package
     itself, i.e. the version of the packaging and not the version of the
     content (see CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_VERSION). One may change the default
     value if the previous packaging was buggy and/or you want to put here
     a fancy Linux distro specific numbering.
  CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_LICENSE - The RPM package license policy.
     Mandatory : YES
     Default   : "unknown"
  CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_GROUP - The RPM package group.
     Mandatory : YES
     Default   : "unknown"
  CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_VENDOR - The RPM package vendor.
     Mandatory : YES
     Default   : CPACK_PACKAGE_VENDOR if set or "unknown"
  CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_URL - The projects URL.
     Mandatory : NO
     Default   : -
  CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION - RPM package description.
     Mandatory : YES
     Default   : CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_FILE if set or "no package description available"
  CPACK_RPM_COMPRESSION_TYPE - RPM compression type.
     Mandatory : NO
     Default   : -
     May be used to override RPM compression type to be used
     to build the RPM. For example some Linux distribution now default
     to lzma or xz compression whereas older cannot use such RPM.
     Using this one can enforce compression type to be used.
     Possible value are: lzma, xz, bzip2 and gzip.
  CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_REQUIRES - RPM spec requires field.
     Mandatory : NO
     Default   : -
     May be used to set RPM dependencies (requires).
     Note that you must enclose the complete requires string between quotes,
     for example:
     set(CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_REQUIRES "python &gt;= 2.5.0, cmake &gt;= 2.8")
     The required package list of an RPM file could be printed with
     rpm -qp --requires file.rpm
  CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_SUGGESTS - RPM spec suggest field.
     Mandatory : NO
     Default   : -
     May be used to set weak RPM dependencies (suggests).
     Note that you must enclose the complete requires string between quotes.
  CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_PROVIDES - RPM spec provides field.
     Mandatory : NO
     Default   : -
     May be used to set RPM dependencies (provides).
     The provided package list of an RPM file could be printed with
     rpm -qp --provides file.rpm
  CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_OBSOLETES - RPM spec obsoletes field.
     Mandatory : NO
     Default   : -
     May be used to set RPM packages that are obsoleted by this one.
  CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_RELOCATABLE - build a relocatable RPM.
     Mandatory : NO
     Default   : CPACK_PACKAGE_RELOCATABLE
     If this variable is set to TRUE or ON CPackRPM will try
     to build a relocatable RPM package. A relocatable RPM may
     be installed using rpm --prefix or --relocate in order to
     install it at an alternate place see rpm(8).
     Note that currently this may fail if CPACK_SET_DESTDIR is set to ON.
     If CPACK_SET_DESTDIR is set then you will get a warning message
     but if there is file installed with absolute path you'll get
     unexpected behavior.
  CPACK_RPM_SPEC_INSTALL_POST - [deprecated].
     Mandatory : NO
     Default   : -
     This way of specifying post-install script is deprecated use
     CPACK_RPM_POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE
     May be used to set an RPM post-install command inside the spec file.
     For example setting it to "/bin/true" may be used to prevent
     rpmbuild to strip binaries.
  CPACK_RPM_SPEC_MORE_DEFINE - RPM extended spec definitions lines.
     Mandatory : NO
     Default   : -
     May be used to add any %define lines to the generated spec file.
  CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_DEBUG - Toggle CPackRPM debug output.
     Mandatory : NO
     Default   : -
     May be set when invoking cpack in order to trace debug information
     during CPack RPM run. For example you may launch CPack like this
     cpack -D CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_DEBUG=1 -G RPM
  CPACK_RPM_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE - A user provided spec file.
     Mandatory : NO
     Default   : -
     May be set by the user in order to specify a USER binary spec file
     to be used by CPackRPM instead of generating the file.
     The specified file will be processed by configure_file( @ONLY).
  CPACK_RPM_GENERATE_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE_TEMPLATE - Spec file template.
     Mandatory : NO
     Default   : -
     If set CPack will generate a template for USER specified binary
     spec file and stop with an error. For example launch CPack like this
     cpack -D CPACK_RPM_GENERATE_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE_TEMPLATE=1 -G RPM
     The user may then use this file in order to hand-craft is own
     binary spec file which may be used with CPACK_RPM_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE.
  CPACK_RPM_PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE
  CPACK_RPM_PRE_UNINSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE
     Mandatory : NO
     Default   : -
     May be used to embed a pre (un)installation script in the spec file.
     The refered script file(s) will be read and directly
     put after the %pre or %preun section
     If CPACK_RPM_COMPONENT_INSTALL is set to ON the (un)install script for
     each component can be overridden with
     CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE and
     CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_PRE_UNINSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE
     One may verify which scriptlet has been included with
      rpm -qp --scripts  package.rpm
  CPACK_RPM_POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE
  CPACK_RPM_POST_UNINSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE
     Mandatory : NO
     Default   : -
     May be used to embed a post (un)installation script in the spec file.
     The refered script file(s) will be read and directly
     put after the %post or %postun section
     If CPACK_RPM_COMPONENT_INSTALL is set to ON the (un)install script for
     each component can be overridden with
     CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE and
     CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_POST_UNINSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE
     One may verify which scriptlet has been included with
      rpm -qp --scripts  package.rpm
  CPACK_RPM_USER_FILELIST
  CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_USER_FILELIST
     Mandatory : NO
     Default   : -
     May be used to explicitly specify %(&lt;directive&gt;) file line
     in the spec file. Like %config(noreplace) or any other directive
     that be found in the %files section. Since CPackRPM is generating
     the list of files (and directories) the user specified files of
     the CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_USER_FILELIST list will be removed from the generated list.
  CPACK_RPM_CHANGELOG_FILE - RPM changelog file.
     Mandatory : NO
     Default   : -
     May be used to embed a changelog in the spec file.
     The refered file will be read and directly put after the %changelog
     section.

<para>(the CDash server can provide the file to a project administrator who configures 'MyProject'). Settings in the config file are shared by both this CTest module and the CTest command-line tool's dashboard script mode (ctest -S).
</para>
<para>While building a project for submission to CDash, CTest scans the build output for errors and warnings and reports them with surrounding context from the build log.  This generic approach works for all build tools, but does not give details about the command invocation that produced a given problem.  One may get more detailed reports by adding
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   set(CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS 1)
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>to the CTestConfig.cmake file.  When this option is enabled, the CTest module tells CMake's Makefile generators to invoke every command in the generated build system through a CTest launcher program.  (Currently the CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS option is ignored on non-Makefile generators.)  During a manual build each launcher transparently runs the command it wraps.  During a CTest-driven build for submission to CDash each launcher reports detailed information when its command fails or warns. (Setting CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS in CTestConfig.cmake is convenient, but also adds the launcher overhead even for manual builds.  One may instead set it in a CTest dashboard script and add it to the CMake cache for the build tree.)</para>

<para>To use launchers, set CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS to ON in a ctest -S dashboard script, and then also set it in the cache of the configured project.

</para>
<para>For convenience, you may set the ENV variable CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS_DEFAULT in your ctest -S script, too. Then, as long as your CMakeLists uses include(CTest) or include(CTestUseLaunchers), it will use the value of the ENV variable to initialize a CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS cache variable. This cache variable initialization only occurs if CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS is not already defined.</para>

<para>Check if the type exists and determine its size. On return, "HAVE_${VARIABLE}" holds the existence of the type, and "${VARIABLE}" holds one of the following:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   &lt;size&gt; = type has non-zero size &lt;size&gt;
   "0"    = type has arch-dependent size (see below)
   ""     = type does not exist

<para>Furthermore, the variable "${VARIABLE}_CODE" holds C preprocessor code to define the macro "${VARIABLE}" to the size of the type, or leave the macro undefined if the type does not exist.
</para>
<para>The variable "${VARIABLE}" may be "0" when CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES has multiple architectures for building OS X universal binaries. This indicates that the type size varies across architectures. In this case "${VARIABLE}_CODE" contains C preprocessor tests mapping from each architecture macro to the corresponding type size. The list of architecture macros is stored in "${VARIABLE}_KEYS", and the value for each key is stored in "${VARIABLE}-${KEY}".
</para>
<para>If the BUILTIN_TYPES_ONLY option is not given, the macro checks for headers &lt;sys/types.h&gt;, &lt;stdint.h&gt;, and &lt;stddef.h&gt;, and saves results in HAVE_SYS_TYPES_H, HAVE_STDINT_H, and HAVE_STDDEF_H.  The type size check automatically includes the available headers, thus supporting checks of types defined in the headers.

<abstract>
<para>Manage data files stored outside source tree</para>
</abstract>
<para>Use this module to unambiguously reference data files stored outside the source tree and fetch them at build time from arbitrary local and remote content-addressed locations.  Functions provided by this module recognize arguments with the syntax "DATA{&lt;name&gt;}" as references to external data, replace them with full paths to local copies of those data, and create build rules to fetch and update the local copies.
</para>
<para>The DATA{} syntax is literal and the &lt;name&gt; is a full or relative path within the source tree.  The source tree must contain either a real data file at &lt;name&gt; or a "content link" at &lt;name&gt;&lt;ext&gt; containing a hash of the real file using a hash algorithm corresponding to &lt;ext&gt;.  For example, the argument "DATA{img.png}" may be satisfied by either a real "img.png" file in the current source directory or a "img.png.md5" file containing its MD5 sum.
</para>
<para>The 'ExternalData_Expand_Arguments' function evaluates DATA{} references in its arguments and constructs a new list of arguments:

    &lt;outVar&gt;   # Output variable
    [args...]  # Input arguments, DATA{} allowed
    )
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>It replaces each DATA{} reference in an argument with the full path of a real data file on disk that will exist after the &lt;target&gt; builds.
</para>
<para>The 'ExternalData_Add_Test' function wraps around the CMake add_test() command but supports DATA{} references in its arguments:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  ExternalData_Add_Test(
    &lt;target&gt;   # Name of data management target
    ...        # Arguments of add_test(), DATA{} allowed
    )
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>It passes its arguments through ExternalData_Expand_Arguments and then invokes add_test() using the results.
</para>
<para>The 'ExternalData_Add_Target' function creates a custom target to manage local instances of data files stored externally:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  ExternalData_Add_Target(
    &lt;target&gt;   # Name of data management target
    )
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>It creates custom commands in the target as necessary to make data files available for each DATA{} reference previously evaluated by other functions provided by this module.  A list of URL templates must be provided in the variable ExternalData_URL_TEMPLATES using the placeholders "%(algo)" and "%(hash)" in each template.  Data fetch rules try each URL template in order by substituting the hash algorithm name for "%(algo)" and the hash value for "%(hash)".
</para>
<para>The following hash algorithms are supported:
</para>

     NAME MyTest
     COMMAND MyExe DATA{MyInput.png}
     )
   ExternalData_Add_Target(MyData)
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>When test "MyTest" runs the "DATA{MyInput.png}" argument will be replaced by the full path to a real instance of the data file "MyInput.png" on disk.  If the source tree contains a content link such as "MyInput.png.md5" then the "MyData" target creates a real "MyInput.png" in the build tree.
</para>
<para>The DATA{} syntax can be told to fetch a file series using the form "DATA{&lt;name&gt;,:}", where the ":" is literal.  If the source tree contains a group of files or content links named like a series then a reference to one member adds rules to fetch all of them.  Although all members of a series are fetched, only the file originally named by the DATA{} argument is substituted for it.  The default configuration recognizes file series names ending with "#.ext", "_#.ext", ".#.ext", or "-#.ext" where "#" is a sequence of decimal digits and ".ext" is any single extension.  Configure it with a regex that parses &lt;number&gt; and &lt;suffix&gt; parts from the end of &lt;name&gt;:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE = regex of the form (&lt;number&gt;)(&lt;suffix&gt;)$

</para>
<para>For more complicated cases set:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE = regex with at least two () groups
  ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE_PREFIX = &lt;prefix&gt; regex group number, if any
  ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE_NUMBER = &lt;number&gt; regex group number
  ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE_SUFFIX = &lt;suffix&gt; regex group number

</para>
<para>

</programlisting>
</para>
<para>Note that the &lt;suffix&gt; of a series does not include a hash-algorithm extension.
</para>
<para>The DATA{} syntax can alternatively match files associated with the named file and contained in the same directory.  Associated files may be specified by options using the syntax DATA{&lt;name&gt;,&lt;opt1&gt;,&lt;opt2&gt;,...}.  Each option may specify one file by name or specify a regular expression to match file names using the syntax REGEX:&lt;regex&gt;.  For example, the arguments
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   DATA{MyData/MyInput.mhd,MyInput.img}                   # File pair
   DATA{MyData/MyFrames00.png,REGEX:MyFrames[0-9]+\\.png} # Series
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>will pass MyInput.mha and MyFrames00.png on the command line but ensure that the associated files are present next to them.
</para>
<para>The DATA{} syntax may reference a directory using a trailing slash and a list of associated files.  The form DATA{&lt;name&gt;/,&lt;opt1&gt;,&lt;opt2&gt;,...} adds rules to fetch any files in the directory that match one of the associated file options.  For example, the argument DATA{MyDataDir/,REGEX:.*} will pass the full path to a MyDataDir directory on the command line and ensure that the directory contains files corresponding to every file or content link in the MyDataDir source directory.
</para>
<para>The variable ExternalData_LINK_CONTENT may be set to the name of a supported hash algorithm to enable automatic conversion of real data files referenced by the DATA{} syntax into content links.  For each such &lt;file&gt; a content link named "&lt;file&gt;&lt;ext&gt;" is created.  The original file is renamed to the form ".ExternalData_&lt;algo&gt;_&lt;hash&gt;" to stage it for future transmission to one of the locations in the list of URL templates (by means outside the scope of this module).  The data fetch rule created for the content link will use the staged object if it cannot be found using any URL template.
</para>
<para>The variable ExternalData_OBJECT_STORES may be set to a list of local directories that store objects using the layout &lt;dir&gt;/%(algo)/%(hash). These directories will be searched first for a needed object.  If the object is not available in any store then it will be fetched remotely using the URL templates and added to the first local store listed.  If no stores are specified the default is a location inside the build tree.
</para>
<para>The variable ExternalData_SOURCE_ROOT may be set to the highest source directory containing any path named by a DATA{} reference.  The default is CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR.  ExternalData_SOURCE_ROOT and CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR must refer to directories within a single source distribution (e.g. they come together in one tarball).
</para>
<para>The variable ExternalData_BINARY_ROOT may be set to the directory to hold the real data files named by expanded DATA{} references.  The default is CMAKE_BINARY_DIR.  The directory layout will mirror that of content links under ExternalData_SOURCE_ROOT.
</para>
<para>Variables ExternalData_TIMEOUT_INACTIVITY and ExternalData_TIMEOUT_ABSOLUTE set the download inactivity and absolute timeouts, in seconds.  The defaults are 60 seconds and 300 seconds, respectively.  Set either timeout to 0 seconds to disable enforcement.</para>

</para>
<para>The *_DIR options specify directories for the project, with default directories computed as follows. If the PREFIX option is given to ExternalProject_Add() or the EP_PREFIX directory property is set, then an external project is built and installed under the specified prefix:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   TMP_DIR      = &lt;prefix&gt;/tmp
   STAMP_DIR    = &lt;prefix&gt;/src/&lt;name&gt;-stamp
   DOWNLOAD_DIR = &lt;prefix&gt;/src
   SOURCE_DIR   = &lt;prefix&gt;/src/&lt;name&gt;
   BINARY_DIR   = &lt;prefix&gt;/src/&lt;name&gt;-build
   INSTALL_DIR  = &lt;prefix&gt;
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>Otherwise, if the EP_BASE directory property is set then components of an external project are stored under the specified base:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   TMP_DIR      = &lt;base&gt;/tmp/&lt;name&gt;
   STAMP_DIR    = &lt;base&gt;/Stamp/&lt;name&gt;
   DOWNLOAD_DIR = &lt;base&gt;/Download/&lt;name&gt;
   SOURCE_DIR   = &lt;base&gt;/Source/&lt;name&gt;
   BINARY_DIR   = &lt;base&gt;/Build/&lt;name&gt;
   INSTALL_DIR  = &lt;base&gt;/Install/&lt;name&gt;
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>If no PREFIX, EP_PREFIX, or EP_BASE is specified then the default is to set PREFIX to "&lt;name&gt;-prefix". Relative paths are interpreted with respect to the build directory corresponding to the source directory in which ExternalProject_Add is invoked.
</para>
<para>If SOURCE_DIR is explicitly set to an existing directory the project will be built from it. Otherwise a download step must be specified using one of the DOWNLOAD_COMMAND, CVS_*, SVN_*, or URL options. The URL option may refer locally to a directory or source tarball, or refer to a remote tarball (e.g. <ulink url="http://.../src.tgz" />).
</para>
<para>The 'ExternalProject_Add_Step' function adds a custom step to an external project:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  ExternalProject_Add_Step(&lt;name&gt; &lt;step&gt; # Names of project and custom step
    [COMMAND cmd...]        # Command line invoked by this step
    [COMMENT "text..."]     # Text printed when step executes
    [DEPENDEES steps...]    # Steps on which this step depends
    [DEPENDERS steps...]    # Steps that depend on this step
    [DEPENDS files...]      # Files on which this step depends
    [ALWAYS 1]              # No stamp file, step always runs
    [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir] # Working directory for command
    [LOG 1]                 # Wrap step in script to log output
    )
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>The command line, comment, and working directory of every standard and custom step is processed to replace tokens &lt;SOURCE_DIR&gt;, &lt;BINARY_DIR&gt;, &lt;INSTALL_DIR&gt;, and &lt;TMP_DIR&gt; with corresponding property values.
</para>
<para>The 'ExternalProject_Get_Property' function retrieves external project target properties:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  ExternalProject_Get_Property(&lt;name&gt; [prop1 [prop2 [...]]])
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>It stores property values in variables of the same name. Property names correspond to the keyword argument names of 'ExternalProject_Add'.
</para>
<para>The 'ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets' function generates custom targets for the steps listed:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets(&lt;name&gt; [step1 [step2 [...]]])
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>If STEP_TARGETS is set then ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets is automatically called at the end of matching calls to ExternalProject_Add_Step. Pass STEP_TARGETS explicitly to individual ExternalProject_Add calls, or implicitly to all ExternalProject_Add calls by setting the directory property EP_STEP_TARGETS.
</para>
<para>If STEP_TARGETS is not set, clients may still manually call ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets after calling ExternalProject_Add or ExternalProject_Add_Step.
</para>
<para>This functionality is provided to make it easy to drive the steps independently of each other by specifying targets on build command lines. For example, you may be submitting to a sub-project based dashboard, where you want to drive the configure portion of the build, then submit to the dashboard, followed by the build portion, followed by tests. If you invoke a custom target that depends on a step halfway through the step dependency chain, then all the previous steps will also run to ensure everything is up to date.
</para>
<para>For example, to drive configure, build and test steps independently for each ExternalProject_Add call in your project, write the following line prior to any ExternalProject_Add calls in your CMakeLists file:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   set_property(DIRECTORY PROPERTY EP_STEP_TARGETS configure build test)

<para>The FEATURE_SUMMARY() macro can be used to print information about enabled or disabled packages or features of a project. By default, only the names of the features/packages will be printed and their required version when one was specified. Use SET_PACKAGE_PROPERTIES() to add more useful information, like e.g. a download URL for the respective package or their purpose in the project.
</para>
<para>The WHAT option is the only mandatory option. Here you specify what information will be printed:

<para>If a FILENAME is given, the information is printed into this file. If APPEND is used, it is appended to this file, otherwise the file is overwritten if it already existed. If the VAR option is used, the information is "printed" into the specified variable. If FILENAME is not used, the information is printed to the terminal. Using the DESCRIPTION option a description or headline can be set which will be printed above the actual content. If INCLUDE_QUIET_PACKAGES is given, packages which have been searched with find_package(... QUIET) will also be listed. By default they are skipped. If FATAL_ON_MISSING_REQUIRED_PACKAGES is given, CMake will abort if a package which is marked as REQUIRED has not been found.

<para>
</para>
<para>Use this macro to set up information about the named package, which can then be displayed via FEATURE_SUMMARY(). This can be done either directly in the Find-module or in the project which uses the module after the find_package() call. The features for which information can be set are added automatically by the find_package() command.
</para>
<para>URL: this should be the homepage of the package, or something similar. Ideally this is set already directly in the Find-module.
</para>
<para>DESCRIPTION: A short description what that package is, at most one sentence. Ideally this is set already directly in the Find-module.
</para>
<para>TYPE: What type of dependency has the using project on that package. Default is OPTIONAL. In this case it is a package which can be used by the project when available at buildtime, but it also work without. RECOMMENDED is similar to OPTIONAL, i.e. the project will build if the package is not present, but the functionality of the resulting binaries will be severly limited. If a REQUIRED package is not available at buildtime, the project may not even build. This can be combined with the FATAL_ON_MISSING_REQUIRED_PACKAGES argument for feature_summary(). Last, a RUNTIME package is a package which is actually not used at all during the build, but which is required for actually running the resulting binaries. So if such a package is missing, the project can still be built, but it may not work later on. If set_package_properties() is called multiple times for the same package with different TYPEs, the TYPE is only changed to higher TYPEs ( RUNTIME &lt; OPTIONAL &lt; RECOMMENDED &lt; REQUIRED ), lower TYPEs are ignored. The TYPE property is project-specific, so it cannot be set by the Find-module, but must be set in the project.
</para>
<para>PURPOSE: This describes which features this package enables in the project, i.e. it tells the user what functionality he gets in the resulting binaries. If set_package_properties() is called multiple times for a package, all PURPOSE properties are appended to a list of purposes of the package in the project. As the TYPE property, also the PURPOSE property is project-specific, so it cannot be set by the Find-module, but must be set in the project.

<para>This module finds an installed fortran library that implements the BLAS linear-algebra interface (see <ulink url="http://www.netlib.org/blas/" />). The list of libraries searched for is taken from the autoconf macro file, acx_blas.m4 (distributed at <ulink url="http://ac-archive.sourceforge.net/ac-archive/acx_blas.html" />).
</para>
<para>This module sets the following variables:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  BLAS_FOUND - set to true if a library implementing the BLAS interface
    is found
  BLAS_LINKER_FLAGS - uncached list of required linker flags (excluding -l
    and -L).
  BLAS_LIBRARIES - uncached list of libraries (using full path name) to
    link against to use BLAS
  BLAS95_LIBRARIES - uncached list of libraries (using full path name)
    to link against to use BLAS95 interface
  BLAS95_FOUND - set to true if a library implementing the BLAS f95 interface
    is found
  BLA_STATIC  if set on this determines what kind of linkage we do (static)
  BLA_VENDOR  if set checks only the specified vendor, if not set checks
     all the possibilities
  BLA_F95     if set on tries to find the f95 interfaces for BLAS/LAPACK

<para>This module finds headers and requested component libraries OR a CMake package configuration file provided by a "Boost CMake" build.  For the latter case skip to the "Boost CMake" section below.  For the former case results are reported in variables:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  Boost_FOUND            - True if headers and requested libraries were found
  Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS     - Boost include directories
  Boost_LIBRARY_DIRS     - Link directories for Boost libraries

<para>This module reads hints about search locations from variables:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  BOOST_ROOT             - Preferred installation prefix
   (or BOOSTROOT)
  BOOST_INCLUDEDIR       - Preferred include directory e.g. &lt;prefix&gt;/include
  BOOST_LIBRARYDIR       - Preferred library directory e.g. &lt;prefix&gt;/lib
  Boost_NO_SYSTEM_PATHS  - Set to ON to disable searching in locations not
                           specified by these hint variables. Default is OFF.
  Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS
                         - List of Boost versions not known to this module
                           (Boost install locations may contain the version)
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>and saves search results persistently in CMake cache entries:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  Boost_INCLUDE_DIR         - Directory containing Boost headers
  Boost_LIBRARY_DIR         - Directory containing Boost libraries
  Boost_&lt;C&gt;_LIBRARY_DEBUG   - Component &lt;C&gt; library debug variant
  Boost_&lt;C&gt;_LIBRARY_RELEASE - Component &lt;C&gt; library release variant
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>Users may set the these hints or results as cache entries.  Projects should not read these entries directly but instead use the above result variables. Note that some hint names start in upper-case "BOOST".  One may specify these as environment variables if they are not specified as CMake variables or cache entries.
</para>
<para>This module first searches for the Boost header files using the above hint variables (excluding BOOST_LIBRARYDIR) and saves the result in Boost_INCLUDE_DIR.  Then it searches for requested component libraries using the above hints (excluding BOOST_INCLUDEDIR and Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS), "lib" directories near Boost_INCLUDE_DIR, and the library name configuration settings below.  It saves the library directory in Boost_LIBRARY_DIR and individual library locations in Boost_&lt;C&gt;_LIBRARY_DEBUG and Boost_&lt;C&gt;_LIBRARY_RELEASE.  When one changes settings used by previous searches in the same build tree (excluding environment variables) this module discards previous search results affected by the changes and searches again.
</para>
<para>Boost libraries come in many variants encoded in their file name.  Users or projects may tell this module which variant to find by setting variables:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  Boost_USE_MULTITHREADED  - Set to OFF to use the non-multithreaded
                             libraries ('mt' tag).  Default is ON.
  Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS    - Set to ON to force the use of the static
                             libraries.  Default is OFF.
  Boost_USE_STATIC_RUNTIME - Set to ON or OFF to specify whether to use
                             libraries linked statically to the C++ runtime
                             ('s' tag).  Default is platform dependent.
  Boost_USE_DEBUG_PYTHON   - Set to ON to use libraries compiled with a
                             debug Python build ('y' tag). Default is OFF.
  Boost_USE_STLPORT        - Set to ON to use libraries compiled with
                             STLPort ('p' tag).  Default is OFF.
  Boost_USE_STLPORT_DEPRECATED_NATIVE_IOSTREAMS
                           - Set to ON to use libraries compiled with
                             STLPort deprecated "native iostreams"
                             ('n' tag).  Default is OFF.
  Boost_COMPILER           - Set to the compiler-specific library suffix
                             (e.g. "-gcc43").  Default is auto-computed
                             for the C++ compiler in use.
  Boost_THREADAPI          - Suffix for "thread" component library name,
                             such as "pthread" or "win32".  Names with
                             and without this suffix will both be tried.
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>Other variables one may set to control this module are:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  Boost_DEBUG              - Set to ON to enable debug output from FindBoost.
                             Please enable this before filing any bug report.
  Boost_DETAILED_FAILURE_MSG
                           - Set to ON to add detailed information to the
                             failure message even when the REQUIRED option
                             is not given to the find_package call.
  Boost_REALPATH           - Set to ON to resolve symlinks for discovered
                             libraries to assist with packaging.  For example,
                             the "system" component library may be resolved to
                             "/usr/lib/libboost_system.so.1.42.0" instead of
                             "/usr/lib/libboost_system.so".  This does not
                             affect linking and should not be enabled unless
                             the user needs this information.

</para>
<para>On Visual Studio and Borland compilers Boost headers request automatic linking to corresponding libraries.  This requires matching libraries to be linked explicitly or available in the link library search path.  In this case setting Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS to OFF may not achieve dynamic linking.

<para>This script makes use of the standard find_package arguments of &lt;VERSION&gt;, REQUIRED and QUIET.  CUDA_FOUND will report if an acceptable version of CUDA was found.
</para>
<para>The script will prompt the user to specify CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR if the prefix cannot be determined by the location of nvcc in the system path and REQUIRED is specified to find_package(). To use a different installed version of the toolkit set the environment variable CUDA_BIN_PATH before running cmake (e.g. CUDA_BIN_PATH=/usr/local/cuda1.0 instead of the default /usr/local/cuda) or set CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR after configuring.  If you change the value of CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR, various components that depend on the path will be relocated.

<programlisting>  CUDA_64_BIT_DEVICE_CODE (Default matches host bit size)
  -- Set to ON to compile for 64 bit device code, OFF for 32 bit device code.
     Note that making this different from the host code when generating object
     or C files from CUDA code just won't work, because size_t gets defined by
     nvcc in the generated source.  If you compile to PTX and then load the

<para>
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>     This allows the user to build the target from the CUDA file; however, bad
     things can happen if the CUDA source file is added to multiple targets.
     When performing parallel builds it is possible for the custom build
     command to be run more than once and in parallel causing cryptic build
     errors.  VS runs the rules for every source file in the target, and a
     source can have only one rule no matter how many projects it is added to.
     When the rule is run from multiple targets race conditions can occur on
     the generated file.  Eventually everything will get built, but if the user
     is unaware of this behavior, there may be confusion.  It would be nice if
     this script could detect the reuse of source files across multiple targets
     and turn the option off for the user, but no good solution could be found.

     generated host code match the rest of the system better.  Sometimes
     certain flags give nvcc problems, and this will help you turn the flag
     propagation off.  This does not affect the flags supplied directly to nvcc
     via CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS or through the OPTION flags specified through

<programlisting>     For certain configurations (namely VS generating object files with
     CUDA_ATTACH_VS_BUILD_RULE_TO_CUDA_FILE set to ON), no generated file will
     be produced for the given cuda file.  This is because when you add the
     cuda file to Visual Studio it knows that this file produces an object file
     and will link in the resulting object file automatically.

<programlisting>     This script will also generate a separate cmake script that is used at

</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>       1. nvcc can return negative numbers as return values which confuses
       Visual Studio into thinking that the command succeeded.  The script now
       checks the error codes and produces errors when there was a problem.
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>       2. nvcc has been known to not delete incomplete results when it
       encounters problems.  This confuses build systems into thinking the
       target was generated when in fact an unusable file exists.  The script
       now deletes the output files if there was an error.
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>       3. By putting all the options that affect the build into a file and then

<programlisting>     This script also looks at optional arguments STATIC, SHARED, or MODULE to
     determine when to target the object compilation for a shared library.
     BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is ignored in CUDA_WRAP_SRCS, but it is respected in
     CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY.  On some systems special flags are added for building
     objects intended for shared libraries.  A preprocessor macro,
     &lt;target_name&gt;_EXPORTS is defined when a shared library compilation is
     detected.

   ILU_LIBRARIES -  the name of the ILU library. Again, the full path. This
                    library is for filters and effects, not actual loading. It
                    doesn't have to be linked if the functionality it provides
                    is not used.
   ILUT_LIBRARIES - the name of the ILUT library. Full path. This part of the
                    library interfaces with OpenGL. It is not strictly needed
                    in applications.
   IL_INCLUDE_DIR - where to find the il.h, ilu.h and ilut.h files.
   IL_FOUND -       this is set to TRUE if all the above variables were set.
                    This will be set to false if ILU or ILUT are not found,
                    even if they are not needed. In most systems, if one

<para>This module invokes the HDF5 wrapper compiler that should be installed alongside HDF5.  Depending upon the HDF5 Configuration, the wrapper compiler is called either h5cc or h5pcc.  If this succeeds, the module will then call the compiler with the -show argument to see what flags are used when compiling an HDF5 client application.
</para>
<para>The module will optionally accept the COMPONENTS argument.  If no COMPONENTS are specified, then the find module will default to finding only the HDF5 C library.  If one or more COMPONENTS are specified, the module will attempt to find the language bindings for the specified components.  The only valid components are C, CXX, Fortran, HL, and Fortran_HL.  If the COMPONENTS argument is not given, the module will attempt to find only the C bindings.
</para>
<para>On UNIX systems, this module will read the variable HDF5_USE_STATIC_LIBRARIES to determine whether or not to prefer a static link to a dynamic link for HDF5 and all of it's dependencies.  To use this feature, make sure that the HDF5_USE_STATIC_LIBRARIES variable is set before the call to find_package.
</para>
<para>To provide the module with a hint about where to find your HDF5 installation, you can set the environment variable HDF5_ROOT.  The Find module will then look in this path when searching for HDF5 executables, paths, and libraries.

<para>=== Variables ===
</para>
<para>This module will set the following variables per language in your project, where &lt;lang&gt; is one of C, CXX, or Fortran:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_FOUND           TRUE if FindMPI found MPI flags for &lt;lang&gt;
   MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_COMPILER        MPI Compiler wrapper for &lt;lang&gt;
   MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_COMPILE_FLAGS   Compilation flags for MPI programs
   MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_INCLUDE_PATH    Include path(s) for MPI header
   MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_LINK_FLAGS      Linking flags for MPI programs
   MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_LIBRARIES       All libraries to link MPI programs against
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>Additionally, FindMPI sets the following variables for running MPI programs from the command line:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   MPIEXEC                    Executable for running MPI programs
   MPIEXEC_NUMPROC_FLAG       Flag to pass to MPIEXEC before giving
                              it the number of processors to run on
   MPIEXEC_PREFLAGS           Flags to pass to MPIEXEC directly
                              before the executable to run.
   MPIEXEC_POSTFLAGS          Flags to pass to MPIEXEC after other flags
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>=== Usage ===
</para>
<para>To use this module, simply call FindMPI from a CMakeLists.txt file, or run find_package(MPI), then run CMake.  If you are happy with the auto- detected configuration for your language, then you're done.  If not, you have two options:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   1. Set MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_COMPILER to the MPI wrapper (mpicc, etc.) of your
      choice and reconfigure.  FindMPI will attempt to determine all the
      necessary variables using THAT compiler's compile and link flags.
   2. If this fails, or if your MPI implementation does not come with
      a compiler wrapper, then set both MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_LIBRARIES and
      MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_INCLUDE_PATH.  You may also set any other variables
      listed above, but these two are required.  This will circumvent
      autodetection entirely.
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>When configuration is successful, MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_COMPILER will be set to the compiler wrapper for &lt;lang&gt;, if it was found.  MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_FOUND and other variables above will be set if any MPI implementation was found for &lt;lang&gt;, regardless of whether a compiler was found.
</para>
<para>When using MPIEXEC to execute MPI applications, you should typically use all of the MPIEXEC flags as follows:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   ${MPIEXEC} ${MPIEXEC_NUMPROC_FLAG} PROCS
     ${MPIEXEC_PREFLAGS} EXECUTABLE ${MPIEXEC_POSTFLAGS} ARGS
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>where PROCS is the number of processors on which to execute the program, EXECUTABLE is the MPI program, and ARGS are the arguments to pass to the MPI program.
</para>
<para>=== Backward Compatibility ===
</para>
<para>For backward compatibility with older versions of FindMPI, these variables are set, but deprecated:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   MPI_FOUND           MPI_COMPILER        MPI_LIBRARY
   MPI_COMPILE_FLAGS   MPI_INCLUDE_PATH    MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY

<abstract>
<para> </para>
</abstract>
<para>FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS(&lt;name&gt; ... )
</para>
<para>This function is intended to be used in FindXXX.cmake modules files. It handles the REQUIRED, QUIET and version-related arguments to find_package(). It also sets the &lt;packagename&gt;_FOUND variable. The package is considered found if all variables &lt;var1&gt;... listed contain valid results, e.g. valid filepaths.
</para>
<para>There are two modes of this function. The first argument in both modes is the name of the Find-module where it is called (in original casing).
</para>
<para>The first simple mode looks like this:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>    FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS(&lt;name&gt; (DEFAULT_MSG|"Custom failure message") &lt;var1&gt;...&lt;varN&gt; )
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>If the variables &lt;var1&gt; to &lt;varN&gt; are all valid, then &lt;UPPERCASED_NAME&gt;_FOUND will be set to TRUE. If DEFAULT_MSG is given as second argument, then the function will generate itself useful success and error messages. You can also supply a custom error message for the failure case. This is not recommended.
</para>
<para>The second mode is more powerful and also supports version checking:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>    FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS(NAME [FOUND_VAR &lt;resultVar&gt;]
                                           [REQUIRED_VARS &lt;var1&gt;...&lt;varN&gt;]
                                           [VERSION_VAR   &lt;versionvar&gt;]
                                           [HANDLE_COMPONENTS]
                                           [CONFIG_MODE]
                                           [FAIL_MESSAGE "Custom failure message"] )
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>In this mode, the name of the result-variable can be set either to either &lt;UPPERCASED_NAME&gt;_FOUND or &lt;OriginalCase_Name&gt;_FOUND using the FOUND_VAR option. Other names for the result-variable are not allowed. So for a Find-module named FindFooBar.cmake, the two possible names are FooBar_FOUND and FOOBAR_FOUND. It is recommended to use the original case version. If the FOUND_VAR option is not used, the default is &lt;UPPERCASED_NAME&gt;_FOUND.
</para>
<para>As in the simple mode, if &lt;var1&gt; through &lt;varN&gt; are all valid, &lt;packagename&gt;_FOUND will be set to TRUE. After REQUIRED_VARS the variables which are required for this package are listed. Following VERSION_VAR the name of the variable can be specified which holds the version of the package which has been found. If this is done, this version will be checked against the (potentially) specified required version used in the find_package() call. The EXACT keyword is also handled. The default messages include information about the required version and the version which has been actually found, both if the version is ok or not. If the package supports components, use the HANDLE_COMPONENTS option to enable handling them. In this case, find_package_handle_standard_args() will report which components have been found and which are missing, and the &lt;packagename&gt;_FOUND variable will be set to FALSE if any of the required components (i.e. not the ones listed after OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS) are missing. Use the option CONFIG_MODE if your FindXXX.cmake module is a wrapper for a find_package(... NO_MODULE) call.  In this case VERSION_VAR will be set to &lt;NAME&gt;_VERSION and the macro will automatically check whether the Config module was found. Via FAIL_MESSAGE a custom failure message can be specified, if this is not used, the default message will be displayed.
</para>
<para>Example for mode 1:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>    find_package_handle_standard_args(LibXml2  DEFAULT_MSG  LIBXML2_LIBRARY LIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR)
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>LibXml2 is considered to be found, if both LIBXML2_LIBRARY and LIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR are valid. Then also LIBXML2_FOUND is set to TRUE. If it is not found and REQUIRED was used, it fails with FATAL_ERROR, independent whether QUIET was used or not. If it is found, success will be reported, including the content of &lt;var1&gt;. On repeated Cmake runs, the same message won't be printed again.
</para>
<para>Example for mode 2:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>    find_package_handle_standard_args(LibXslt FOUND_VAR LibXslt_FOUND
                                             REQUIRED_VARS LibXslt_LIBRARIES LibXslt_INCLUDE_DIRS
                                             VERSION_VAR LibXslt_VERSION_STRING)
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>In this case, LibXslt is considered to be found if the variable(s) listed after REQUIRED_VAR are all valid, i.e. LibXslt_LIBRARIES and LibXslt_INCLUDE_DIRS in this case. The result will then be stored in LibXslt_FOUND . Also the version of LibXslt will be checked by using the version contained in LibXslt_VERSION_STRING. Since no FAIL_MESSAGE is given, the default messages will be printed.
</para>
<para>Another example for mode 2:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>    find_package(Automoc4 QUIET NO_MODULE HINTS /opt/automoc4)
    find_package_handle_standard_args(Automoc4  CONFIG_MODE)
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>In this case, FindAutmoc4.cmake wraps a call to find_package(Automoc4 NO_MODULE) and adds an additional search directory for automoc4. Here the result will be stored in AUTOMOC4_FOUND. The following FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS() call produces a proper success/error message.</para>

<para>FIND_PACKAGE_MESSAGE(&lt;name&gt; "message for user" "find result details")
</para>
<para>This macro is intended to be used in FindXXX.cmake modules files. It will print a message once for each unique find result. This is useful for telling the user where a package was found. The first argument specifies the name (XXX) of the package. The second argument specifies the message to display. The third argument lists details about the find result so that if they change the message will be displayed again. The macro also obeys the QUIET argument to the find_package command.

<para>Find Qt 4</para>
</abstract>
<para>This module can be used to find Qt4. The most important issue is that the Qt4 qmake is available via the system path. This qmake is then used to detect basically everything else. This module defines a number of key variables and macros. The variable QT_USE_FILE is set which is the path to a CMake file that can be included to compile Qt 4 applications and libraries.  It sets up the compilation environment for include directories, preprocessor defines and populates a QT_LIBRARIES variable.
</para>
<para>Typical usage could be something like:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   find_package(Qt4 4.4.3 REQUIRED QtCore QtGui QtXml)
   include(${QT_USE_FILE})
   add_executable(myexe main.cpp)
   target_link_libraries(myexe ${QT_LIBRARIES})
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>The minimum required version can be specified using the standard find_package()-syntax (see example above). For compatibility with older versions of FindQt4.cmake it is also possible to set the variable QT_MIN_VERSION to the minimum required version of Qt4 before the find_package(Qt4) command. If both are used, the version used in the find_package() command overrides the one from QT_MIN_VERSION.
</para>
<para>When using the components argument, QT_USE_QT* variables are automatically set for the QT_USE_FILE to pick up.  If one wishes to manually set them, the available ones to set include:

<programlisting>  QT_USE_IMPORTED_TARGETS
        If this variable is set to TRUE, FindQt4.cmake will create imported
        library targets for the various Qt libraries and set the
        library variables like QT_QTCORE_LIBRARY to point at these imported
        targets instead of the library file on disk. This provides much better
        handling of the release and debug versions of the Qt libraries and is
       also always backwards compatible, except for the case that dependencies
       of libraries are exported, these will then also list the names of the
       imported targets as dependency and not the file location on disk. This
       is much more flexible, but requires that FindQt4.cmake is executed before
       such an exported dependency file is processed.

        because you need a custom filename for the moc file or something similar.

<para>
<programlisting>  macro QT4_AUTOMOC(sourcefile1 sourcefile2 ... )
        This macro is still experimental.
        It can be used to have moc automatically handled.
        So if you have the files foo.h and foo.cpp, and in foo.h a
        a class uses the Q_OBJECT macro, moc has to run on it. If you don't
        want to use QT4_WRAP_CPP() (which is reliable and mature), you can insert
        #include "foo.moc"
        in foo.cpp and then give foo.cpp as argument to QT4_AUTOMOC(). This will the
        scan all listed files at cmake-time for such included moc files and if it finds
        them cause a rule to be generated to run moc at build time on the
        accompanying header file foo.h.
        If a source file has the SKIP_AUTOMOC property set it will be ignored by this macro.

        forwards the calls to a parent class, defined in parentheader and named
        parentclassname. The name of the generated files will be
        &lt;basename&gt;adaptor.{cpp,h} where basename defaults to the basename of the xml file.

        created and/or updated in the source tree (unless given with full paths).
        The qm files are generated in the build tree.
        Updating the translations can be done by adding the qm_files

<para>Modified by Eric Wing. Added code to assist with automated building by using environmental variables and providing a more controlled/consistent search behavior. Added new modifications to recognize OS X frameworks and additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc). Also corrected the header search path to follow "proper" SDL guidelines. Added a search for SDLmain which is needed by some platforms. Added a search for threads which is needed by some platforms. Added needed compile switches for MinGW.

</para>
<para>Note that the header path has changed from SDL/SDL.h to just SDL.h This needed to change because "proper" SDL convention is #include "SDL.h", not &lt;SDL/SDL.h&gt;. This is done for portability reasons because not all systems place things in SDL/ (see FreeBSD).</para>

<para>Typically, you should not use these variables directly, and you should use SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES which contains SDL_SOUND_LIBRARY and the other audio libraries (if needed) to successfully compile on your system.
</para>
<para>Created by Eric Wing. This module is a bit more complicated than the other FindSDL* family modules. The reason is that SDL_sound can be compiled in a large variety of different ways which are independent of platform. SDL_sound may dynamically link against other 3rd party libraries to get additional codec support, such as Ogg Vorbis, SMPEG, ModPlug, MikMod, FLAC, Speex, and potentially others. Under some circumstances which I don't fully understand, there seems to be a requirement that dependent libraries of libraries you use must also be explicitly linked against in order to successfully compile. SDL_sound does not currently have any system in place to know how it was compiled. So this CMake module does the hard work in trying to discover which 3rd party libraries are required for building (if any). This module uses a brute force approach to create a test program that uses SDL_sound, and then tries to build it. If the build fails, it parses the error output for known symbol names to figure out which libraries are needed.

<para>Find a wxWidgets (a.k.a., wxWindows) installation.</para>
</abstract>
<para>This module finds if wxWidgets is installed and selects a default configuration to use. wxWidgets is a modular library. To specify the modules that you will use, you need to name them as components to the package:
</para>
<para>find_package(wxWidgets COMPONENTS core base ...)
</para>
<para>There are two search branches: a windows style and a unix style. For windows, the following variables are searched for and set to defaults in case of multiple choices. Change them if the defaults are not desired (i.e., these are the only variables you should change to select a configuration):
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  wxWidgets_ROOT_DIR      - Base wxWidgets directory
                            (e.g., C:/wxWidgets-2.6.3).
  wxWidgets_LIB_DIR       - Path to wxWidgets libraries
                            (e.g., C:/wxWidgets-2.6.3/lib/vc_lib).
  wxWidgets_CONFIGURATION - Configuration to use
                            (e.g., msw, mswd, mswu, mswunivud, etc.)
  wxWidgets_EXCLUDE_COMMON_LIBRARIES
                          - Set to TRUE to exclude linking of
                            commonly required libs (e.g., png tiff
                            jpeg zlib regex expat).
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>For unix style it uses the wx-config utility. You can select between debug/release, unicode/ansi, universal/non-universal, and static/shared in the QtDialog or ccmake interfaces by turning ON/OFF the following variables:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  wxWidgets_USE_DEBUG
  wxWidgets_USE_UNICODE
  wxWidgets_USE_UNIVERSAL
  wxWidgets_USE_STATIC
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>There is also a wxWidgets_CONFIG_OPTIONS variable for all other options that need to be passed to the wx-config utility. For example, to use the base toolkit found in the /usr/local path, set the variable (before calling the FIND_PACKAGE command) as such:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  set(wxWidgets_CONFIG_OPTIONS --toolkit=base --prefix=/usr)
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>The following are set after the configuration is done for both windows and unix style:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  wxWidgets_FOUND            - Set to TRUE if wxWidgets was found.
  wxWidgets_INCLUDE_DIRS     - Include directories for WIN32
                               i.e., where to find "wx/wx.h" and
                               "wx/setup.h"; possibly empty for unices.
  wxWidgets_LIBRARIES        - Path to the wxWidgets libraries.
  wxWidgets_LIBRARY_DIRS     - compile time link dirs, useful for
                               rpath on UNIX. Typically an empty string
                               in WIN32 environment.
  wxWidgets_DEFINITIONS      - Contains defines required to compile/link
                               against WX, e.g. WXUSINGDLL
  wxWidgets_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG- Contains defines required to compile/link
                               against WX debug builds, e.g. __WXDEBUG__
  wxWidgets_CXX_FLAGS        - Include dirs and compiler flags for
                               unices, empty on WIN32. Essentially
                               "`wx-config --cxxflags`".
  wxWidgets_USE_FILE         - Convenience include file.

</abstract>
<para>This module automatically detects the API by which C and Fortran languages interact.  Variables indicate if the mangling is found:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_FOUND = Global subroutines and functions
   FortranCInterface_MODULE_FOUND = Module subroutines and functions
                                    (declared by "MODULE PROCEDURE")
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>A function is provided to generate a C header file containing macros to mangle symbol names:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   FortranCInterface_HEADER(&lt;file&gt;
                            [MACRO_NAMESPACE &lt;macro-ns&gt;]
                            [SYMBOL_NAMESPACE &lt;ns&gt;]
                            [SYMBOLS [&lt;module&gt;:]&lt;function&gt; ...])
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>It generates in &lt;file&gt; definitions of the following macros:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   #define FortranCInterface_GLOBAL (name,NAME) ...
   #define FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_(name,NAME) ...
   #define FortranCInterface_MODULE (mod,name, MOD,NAME) ...
   #define FortranCInterface_MODULE_(mod,name, MOD,NAME) ...
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>These macros mangle four categories of Fortran symbols, respectively:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   - Global symbols without '_': call mysub()
   - Global symbols with '_'   : call my_sub()
   - Module symbols without '_': use mymod; call mysub()
   - Module symbols with '_'   : use mymod; call my_sub()
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>If mangling for a category is not known, its macro is left undefined. All macros require raw names in both lower case and upper case. The MACRO_NAMESPACE option replaces the default "FortranCInterface_" prefix with a given namespace "&lt;macro-ns&gt;".
</para>
<para>The SYMBOLS option lists symbols to mangle automatically with C preprocessor definitions:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   &lt;function&gt;          ==&gt; #define &lt;ns&gt;&lt;function&gt; ...
   &lt;module&gt;:&lt;function&gt; ==&gt; #define &lt;ns&gt;&lt;module&gt;_&lt;function&gt; ...
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>If the mangling for some symbol is not known then no preprocessor definition is created, and a warning is displayed. The SYMBOL_NAMESPACE option prefixes all preprocessor definitions generated by the SYMBOLS option with a given namespace "&lt;ns&gt;".
</para>
<para>Example usage:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   include(FortranCInterface)
   FortranCInterface_HEADER(FC.h MACRO_NAMESPACE "FC_")
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>This creates a "FC.h" header that defines mangling macros FC_GLOBAL(), FC_GLOBAL_(), FC_MODULE(), and FC_MODULE_().
</para>
<para>Example usage:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   include(FortranCInterface)
   FortranCInterface_HEADER(FCMangle.h
                            MACRO_NAMESPACE "FC_"
                            SYMBOL_NAMESPACE "FC_"
                            SYMBOLS mysub mymod:my_sub)
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>This creates a "FCMangle.h" header that defines the same FC_*() mangling macros as the previous example plus preprocessor symbols FC_mysub and FC_mymod_my_sub.
</para>
<para>Another function is provided to verify that the Fortran and C/C++ compilers work together:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   FortranCInterface_VERIFY([CXX] [QUIET])
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>It tests whether a simple test executable using Fortran and C (and C++ when the CXX option is given) compiles and links successfully. The result is stored in the cache entry FortranCInterface_VERIFIED_C (or FortranCInterface_VERIFIED_CXX if CXX is given) as a boolean. If the check fails and QUIET is not given the function terminates with a FATAL_ERROR message describing the problem.  The purpose of this check is to stop a build early for incompatible compiler combinations.  The test is built in the Release configuration.
</para>
<para>FortranCInterface is aware of possible GLOBAL and MODULE manglings for many Fortran compilers, but it also provides an interface to specify new possible manglings.  Set the variables
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_SYMBOLS
   FortranCInterface_MODULE_SYMBOLS
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>before including FortranCInterface to specify manglings of the symbols "MySub", "My_Sub", "MyModule:MySub", and "My_Module:My_Sub". For example, the code:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   set(FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_SYMBOLS mysub_ my_sub__ MYSUB_)
     #                                  ^^^^^  ^^^^^^   ^^^^^
   set(FortranCInterface_MODULE_SYMBOLS
       __mymodule_MOD_mysub __my_module_MOD_my_sub)
     #   ^^^^^^^^     ^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^     ^^^^^^
   include(FortranCInterface)
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>tells FortranCInterface to try given GLOBAL and MODULE manglings. (The carets point at raw symbol names for clarity in this example but are not needed.)</para>

</para>
<para>ADD_COMPILER_EXPORT_FLAGS( [&lt;output_variable&gt;] )
</para>
<para>By default GENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER() generates macro names in a file name determined by the name of the library. The ADD_COMPILER_EXPORT_FLAGS function adds -fvisibility=hidden to CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS if supported, and is a no-op on Windows which does not need extra compiler flags for exporting support. You may optionally pass a single argument to ADD_COMPILER_EXPORT_FLAGS that will be populated with the required CXX_FLAGS required to enable visibility support for the compiler/architecture in use.
</para>
<para>This means that in the simplest case, users of these functions will be equivalent to:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   add_compiler_export_flags()
   add_library(somelib someclass.cpp)
   generate_export_header(somelib)
   install(TARGETS somelib DESTINATION ${LIBRARY_INSTALL_DIR})

</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>The CMake fragment will generate a file in the ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR} called somelib_export.h containing the macros SOMELIB_EXPORT, SOMELIB_NO_EXPORT, SOMELIB_DEPRECATED, SOMELIB_DEPRECATED_EXPORT and SOMELIB_DEPRECATED_NO_EXPORT. The resulting file should be installed with other headers in the library.
</para>
<para>The BASE_NAME argument can be used to override the file name and the names used for the macros

</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>Generates a file called other_name_export.h containing the macros OTHER_NAME_EXPORT, OTHER_NAME_NO_EXPORT and OTHER_NAME_DEPRECATED etc.
</para>
<para>The BASE_NAME may be overridden by specifiying other options in the function. For example:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   add_library(somelib someclass.cpp)
   generate_export_header(somelib
     EXPORT_MACRO_NAME OTHER_NAME_EXPORT
   )
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>creates the macro OTHER_NAME_EXPORT instead of SOMELIB_EXPORT, but other macros and the generated file name is as default.

     DEPRECATED_MACRO_NAME KDE_DEPRECATED
   )
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>creates the macro KDE_DEPRECATED instead of SOMELIB_DEPRECATED.
</para>
<para>If LIBRARY_TARGET is a static library, macros are defined without values.
</para>
<para>If the same sources are used to create both a shared and a static library, the uppercased symbol ${BASE_NAME}_STATIC_DEFINE should be used when building the static library
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   add_library(shared_variant SHARED ${lib_SRCS})

   set_target_properties(static_variant PROPERTIES
     COMPILE_FLAGS -DLIBSHARED_AND_STATIC_STATIC_DEFINE)
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>This will cause the export macros to expand to nothing when building the static library.
</para>
<para>If DEFINE_NO_DEPRECATED is specified, then a macro ${BASE_NAME}_NO_DEPRECATED will be defined This macro can be used to remove deprecated code from preprocessor output.

</abstract>
<para>By including this file, all library files listed in the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS will be installed with install(PROGRAMS ...) into bin for WIN32 and lib for non-WIN32. If CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS_SKIP is set to TRUE before including this file, then the INSTALL command is not called. The user can use the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS to use a custom install command and install them however they want. If it is the MSVC compiler, then the microsoft run time libraries will be found and automatically added to the CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS, and installed. If CMAKE_INSTALL_DEBUG_LIBRARIES is set and it is the MSVC compiler, then the debug libraries are installed when available. If CMAKE_INSTALL_DEBUG_LIBRARIES_ONLY is set then only the debug libraries are installed when both debug and release are available. If CMAKE_INSTALL_MFC_LIBRARIES is set then the MFC run time libraries are installed as well as the CRT run time libraries. If CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_DESTINATION is set then the libraries are installed to that directory rather than the default. If CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS_NO_WARNINGS is NOT set, then this file warns about required files that do not exist. You can set this variable to ON before including this file to avoid the warning. For example, the Visual Studio Express editions do not include the redistributable files, so if you include this file on a machine with only VS Express installed, you'll get the warning.</para>

<para>This command creates a &lt;target_name&gt;.jar. It compiles the given source files (source) and adds the given resource files (resource) to the jar file. If only resource files are given then just a jar file is created. The list of include jars are added to the classpath when compiling the java sources and also to the dependencies of the target. INCLUDE_JARS also accepts other target names created by add_jar. For backwards compatibility, jar files listed as sources are ignored (as they have been since the first version of this module).

<abstract>
<para>Tell find_package to warn if called without an explicit mode.</para>
</abstract>
<para>If find_package is called without an explicit mode option (MODULE, CONFIG or NO_MODULE) and no Find&lt;pkg&gt;.cmake module is in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH then CMake implicitly assumes that the caller intends to search for a package configuration file.  If no package configuration file is found then the wording of the failure message must account for both the case that the package is really missing and the case that the project has a bug and failed to provide the intended Find module.  If instead the caller specifies an explicit mode option then the failure message can be more specific.
</para>
<para>Set CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_WARN_NO_MODULE to TRUE to tell find_package to warn when it implicitly assumes Config mode.  This helps developers enforce use of an explicit mode in all calls to find_package within a project.</para>

<sect2 id="cmake.variable.CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH">
<title>CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH</title>
<abstract>
<para>Path to be ignored by FIND_XXX() commands.</para>
</abstract>
<para>Specifies directories to be ignored by searches in FIND_XXX() commands.  This is useful in cross-compiled environments where some system directories contain incompatible but possibly linkable libraries. For example, on cross-compiled cluster environments, this allows a user to ignore directories containing libraries meant for the front-end machine that modules like FindX11 (and others) would normally search. By default this is empty; it is intended to be set by the project. Note that CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH takes a list of directory names, NOT a list of prefixes. If you want to ignore paths under prefixes (bin, include, lib, etc.), you'll need to specify them explicitly. See also CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH, CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH.</para>

<para>If "make install" is invoked or INSTALL is built, this directory is pre-pended onto all install directories. This variable defaults to /usr/local on UNIX and c:/Program Files on Windows.
</para>
<para>On UNIX one can use the DESTDIR mechanism in order to relocate the whole installation. DESTDIR means DESTination DIRectory. It is commonly used by makefile users in order to install software at non-default location. It is usually invoked like this:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting> make DESTDIR=/home/john install
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>which will install the concerned software using the installation prefix, e.g. "/usr/local" pre-pended with the DESTDIR value which finally gives "/home/john/usr/local".
</para>
<para>WARNING: DESTDIR may not be used on Windows because installation prefix usually contains a drive letter like in "C:/Program Files" which cannot be pre-pended with some other prefix.</para>

<para>CMake loads the specified file while enabling support for each language from either the project() or enable_language() commands.  It is loaded after CMake's builtin compiler and platform information modules have been loaded but before the information is used.  The file may set platform information variables to override CMake's defaults.
</para>
<para>This feature is intended for use only in overriding information variables that must be set before CMake builds its first test project to check that the compiler for a language works.  It should not be used to load a file in cases that a normal include() will work.  Use it only as a last resort for behavior that cannot be achieved any other way.  For example, one may set CMAKE_C_FLAGS_INIT to change the default value used to initialize CMAKE_C_FLAGS before it is cached.  The override file should NOT be used to set anything that could be set after languages are enabled, such as variables like CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY that affect the placement of binaries.  Information set in the file will be used for try_compile and try_run builds too.</para>

<para>CMake computes for every source file an object file name that is unique to the source file and deterministic with respect to the full path to the source file.  This allows multiple source files in a target to share the same name if they lie in different directories without rebuilding when one is added or removed.  However, it can produce long full paths in a few cases, so CMake shortens the path using a hashing scheme when the full path to an object file exceeds a limit.

<sect2 id="cmake.variable.CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR">
<title>CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR</title>
<abstract>
<para>Build-time reference to per-configuration output subdirectory.</para>
</abstract>
<para>For native build systems supporting multiple configurations in the build tree (such as Visual Studio and Xcode), the value is a reference to a build-time variable specifying the name of the per-configuration output subdirectory.  On Makefile generators this evaluates to "." because there is only one configuration in a build tree.  Example values:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  $(IntDir)        = Visual Studio 6
  $(OutDir)        = Visual Studio 7, 8, 9
  $(Configuration) = Visual Studio 10
  $(CONFIGURATION) = Xcode
  .                = Make-based tools
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>Since these values are evaluated by the native build system, this variable is suitable only for use in command lines that will be evaluated at build time.  Example of intended usage:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  add_executable(mytool mytool.c)
  add_custom_command(
    OUTPUT out.txt
    COMMAND ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool
            ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/in.txt out.txt
    DEPENDS mytool in.txt
    )
  add_custom_target(drive ALL DEPENDS out.txt)
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>Note that CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR is no longer necessary for this purpose but has been left for compatibility with existing projects.  Instead add_custom_command() recognizes executable target names in its COMMAND option, so "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool" can be replaced by just "mytool".
</para>
<para>This variable is read-only.  Setting it is undefined behavior.  In multi-configuration build systems the value of this variable is passed as the value of preprocessor symbol "CMAKE_INTDIR" to the compilation of all source files.</para>

<para>As CMake processes the listfiles in your project this variable will always be set to the directory where the listfile which is currently being processed (CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE) is located.  The value has dynamic scope.  When CMake starts processing commands in a source file it sets this variable to the directory where this file is located.  When CMake finishes processing commands from the file it restores the previous value.  Therefore the value of the variable inside a macro or function is the directory of the file invoking the bottom-most entry on the call stack, not the directory of the file containing the macro or function definition.
