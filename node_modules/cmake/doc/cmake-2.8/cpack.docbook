<title>Description</title>
<para>The "cpack" executable is the CMake packaging program.  CMake-generated build trees created for projects that use the INSTALL_* commands have packaging support.  This program will generate the package.</para>
<para>CMake is a cross-platform build system generator.  Projects specify their build process with platform-independent CMake listfiles included in each directory of a source tree with the name CMakeLists.txt. Users build a project by using CMake to generate a build system for a native tool on their platform.</para>

<para>
</para>
<para>The cmake_add_component command describes an installation component, which the user can opt to install or remove as part of the graphical installation process. compname is the name of the component, as provided to the COMPONENT argument of one or more CMake INSTALL commands.
</para>
<para>DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the component, used in graphical installers to display the component name. This value can be any string.
</para>
<para>DESCRIPTION is an extended description of the component, used in graphical installers to give the user additional information about the component. Descriptions can span multiple lines using "\n" as the line separator. Typically, these descriptions should be no more than a few lines long.
</para>
<para>HIDDEN indicates that this component will be hidden in the graphical installer, so that the user cannot directly change whether it is installed or not.
</para>
<para>REQUIRED indicates that this component is required, and therefore will always be installed. It will be visible in the graphical installer, but it cannot be unselected. (Typically, required components are shown greyed out).
</para>
<para>DISABLED indicates that this component should be disabled (unselected) by default. The user is free to select this component for installation, unless it is also HIDDEN.
</para>
<para>DEPENDS lists the components on which this component depends. If this component is selected, then each of the components listed must also be selected. The dependency information is encoded within the installer itself, so that users cannot install inconsistent sets of components.
</para>
<para>GROUP names the component group of which this component is a part. If not provided, the component will be a standalone component, not part of any component group. Component groups are described with the cpack_add_component_group command, detailed below.
</para>
<para>INSTALL_TYPES lists the installation types of which this component is a part. When one of these installations types is selected, this component will automatically be selected. Installation types are described with the cpack_add_install_type command, detailed below.
</para>
<para>DOWNLOADED indicates that this component should be downloaded on-the-fly by the installer, rather than packaged in with the installer itself. For more information, see the cpack_configure_downloads command.
</para>
<para>ARCHIVE_FILE provides a name for the archive file created by CPack to be used for downloaded components. If not supplied, CPack will create a file with some name based on CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME and the name of the component. See cpack_configure_downloads for more information.</para>

<para>The cpack_add_component_group describes a group of installation components, which will be placed together within the listing of options. Typically, component groups allow the user to select/deselect all of the components within a single group via a single group-level option. Use component groups to reduce the complexity of installers with many options. groupname is an arbitrary name used to identify the group in the GROUP argument of the cpack_add_component command, which is used to place a component in a group. The name of the group must not conflict with the name of any component.
</para>
<para>DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the component group, used in graphical installers to display the component group name. This value can be any string.
</para>
<para>DESCRIPTION is an extended description of the component group, used in graphical installers to give the user additional information about the components within that group. Descriptions can span multiple lines using "\n" as the line separator. Typically, these descriptions should be no more than a few lines long.
</para>
<para>PARENT_GROUP, if supplied, names the parent group of this group. Parent groups are used to establish a hierarchy of groups, providing an arbitrary hierarchy of groups.
</para>
<para>EXPANDED indicates that, by default, the group should show up as "expanded", so that the user immediately sees all of the components within the group. Otherwise, the group will initially show up as a single entry.

<para>The cpack_add_install_type command identifies a set of preselected components that represents a common use case for an application. For example, a "Developer" install type might include an application along with its header and library files, while an "End user" install type might just include the application's executable. Each component identifies itself with one or more install types via the INSTALL_TYPES argument to cpack_add_component.

</para>
<para>
</para>
<para>The cpack_configure_downloads command configures installation-time downloads of selected components. For each downloadable component, CPack will create an archive containing the contents of that component, which should be uploaded to the given site. When the user selects that component for installation, the installer will download and extract the component in place. This feature is useful for creating small installers that only download the requested components, saving bandwidth. Additionally, the installers are small enough that they will be installed as part of the normal installation process, and the "Change" button in Windows Add/Remove Programs control panel will allow one to add or remove parts of the application after the original installation. On Windows, the downloaded-components functionality requires the ZipDLL plug-in for NSIS, available at:

<para>On Mac OS X, installers that download components on-the-fly can only be built and installed on system using Mac OS X 10.5 or later.
</para>
<para>The site argument is a URL where the archives for downloadable components will reside, e.g., <ulink url="http://www.cmake.org/files/2.6.1/installer/" /> All of the archives produced by CPack should be uploaded to that location.
</para>
<para>UPLOAD_DIRECTORY is the local directory where CPack will create the various archives for each of the components. The contents of this directory should be uploaded to a location accessible by the URL given in the site argument. If omitted, CPack will use the directory CPackUploads inside the CMake binary directory to store the generated archives.
</para>
<para>The ALL flag indicates that all components be downloaded. Otherwise, only those components explicitly marked as DOWNLOADED or that have a specified ARCHIVE_FILE will be downloaded. Additionally, the ALL option implies ADD_REMOVE (unless NO_ADD_REMOVE is specified).
</para>
<para>ADD_REMOVE indicates that CPack should install a copy of the installer that can be called from Windows' Add/Remove Programs dialog (via the "Modify" button) to change the set of installed components. NO_ADD_REMOVE turns off this behavior. This option is ignored on Mac OS X.</para>

<title>cmake_policy</title>
<abstract>
<para>Manage CMake Policy settings.</para>
</abstract>
<para>As CMake evolves it is sometimes necessary to change existing behavior in order to fix bugs or improve implementations of existing features.  The CMake Policy mechanism is designed to help keep existing projects building as new versions of CMake introduce changes in behavior.  Each new policy (behavioral change) is given an identifier of the form "CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;" where "&lt;NNNN&gt;" is an integer index.  Documentation associated with each policy describes the OLD and NEW behavior and the reason the policy was introduced.  Projects may set each policy to select the desired behavior.  When CMake needs to know which behavior to use it checks for a setting specified by the project.  If no setting is available the OLD behavior is assumed and a warning is produced requesting that the policy be set.
</para>
<para>The cmake_policy command is used to set policies to OLD or NEW behavior.  While setting policies individually is supported, we encourage projects to set policies based on CMake versions.
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  cmake_policy(VERSION major.minor[.patch[.tweak]])
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>Specify that the current CMake list file is written for the given version of CMake.  All policies introduced in the specified version or earlier will be set to use NEW behavior.  All policies introduced after the specified version will be unset (unless variable CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; sets a default).  This effectively requests behavior preferred as of a given CMake version and tells newer CMake versions to warn about their new policies.  The policy version specified must be at least 2.4 or the command will report an error.  In order to get compatibility features supporting versions earlier than 2.4 see documentation of policy CMP0001.
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  cmake_policy(SET CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; NEW)
  cmake_policy(SET CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; OLD)
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>Tell CMake to use the OLD or NEW behavior for a given policy.  Projects depending on the old behavior of a given policy may silence a policy warning by setting the policy state to OLD.  Alternatively one may fix the project to work with the new behavior and set the policy state to NEW.
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  cmake_policy(GET CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; &lt;variable&gt;)
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>Check whether a given policy is set to OLD or NEW behavior.  The output variable value will be "OLD" or "NEW" if the policy is set, and empty otherwise.
</para>
<para>CMake keeps policy settings on a stack, so changes made by the cmake_policy command affect only the top of the stack.  A new entry on the policy stack is managed automatically for each subdirectory to protect its parents and siblings.  CMake also manages a new entry for scripts loaded by include() and find_package() commands except when invoked with the NO_POLICY_SCOPE option (see also policy CMP0011).  The cmake_policy command provides an interface to manage custom entries on the policy stack:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  cmake_policy(PUSH)
  cmake_policy(POP)
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>Each PUSH must have a matching POP to erase any changes.  This is useful to make temporary changes to policy settings.
</para>
<para>Functions and macros record policy settings when they are created and use the pre-record policies when they are invoked.  If the function or macro implementation sets policies, the changes automatically propagate up through callers until they reach the closest nested policy stack entry.</para>

<para>This command replaces any variables in the input file referenced as ${VAR} or @VAR@ with their values as determined by CMake.  If a variable is not defined, it will be replaced with nothing.  If COPYONLY is specified, then no variable expansion will take place.  If ESCAPE_QUOTES is specified then any substituted quotes will be C-style escaped.  The file will be configured with the current values of CMake variables. If @ONLY is specified, only variables of the form @VAR@ will be replaced and ${VAR} will be ignored.  This is useful for configuring scripts that use ${VAR}.
</para>
<para>Input file lines of the form "#cmakedefine VAR ..." will be replaced with either "#define VAR ..." or "/* #undef VAR */" depending on whether VAR is set in CMake to any value not considered a false constant by the if() command. (Content of "...", if any, is processed as above.) Input file lines of the form "#cmakedefine01 VAR" will be replaced with either "#define VAR 1" or "#define VAR 0" similarly.

<para>Runs the given sequence of one or more commands with the standard output of each process piped to the standard input of the next.  A single standard error pipe is used for all processes.  If WORKING_DIRECTORY is given the named directory will be set as the current working directory of the child processes.  If TIMEOUT is given the child processes will be terminated if they do not finish in the specified number of seconds (fractions are allowed).  If RESULT_VARIABLE is given the variable will be set to contain the result of running the processes.  This will be an integer return code from the last child or a string describing an error condition.  If OUTPUT_VARIABLE or ERROR_VARIABLE are given the variable named will be set with the contents of the standard output and standard error pipes respectively.  If the same variable is named for both pipes their output will be merged in the order produced.  If INPUT_FILE, OUTPUT_FILE, or ERROR_FILE is given the file named will be attached to the standard input of the first process, standard output of the last process, or standard error of all processes respectively.  If OUTPUT_QUIET or ERROR_QUIET is given then the standard output or standard error results will be quietly ignored.  If more than one OUTPUT_* or ERROR_* option is given for the same pipe the precedence is not specified.  If no OUTPUT_* or ERROR_* options are given the output will be shared with the corresponding pipes of the CMake process itself.

<para>WRITE will write a message into a file called 'filename'. It overwrites the file if it already exists, and creates the file if it does not exist. (If the file is a build input, use configure_file to update the file only when its content changes.)
</para>
<para>APPEND will write a message into a file same as WRITE, except it will append it to the end of the file
</para>
<para>READ will read the content of a file and store it into the variable. It will start at the given offset and read up to numBytes. If the argument HEX is given, the binary data will be converted to hexadecimal representation and this will be stored in the variable.
</para>
<para>MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 will compute a cryptographic hash of the content of a file.
</para>
<para>STRINGS will parse a list of ASCII strings from a file and store it in a variable. Binary data in the file are ignored. Carriage return (CR) characters are ignored. It works also for Intel Hex and Motorola S-record files, which are automatically converted to binary format when reading them. Disable this using NO_HEX_CONVERSION.
</para>
<para>LIMIT_COUNT sets the maximum number of strings to return. LIMIT_INPUT sets the maximum number of bytes to read from the input file. LIMIT_OUTPUT sets the maximum number of bytes to store in the output variable. LENGTH_MINIMUM sets the minimum length of a string to return. Shorter strings are ignored. LENGTH_MAXIMUM sets the maximum length of a string to return.  Longer strings are split into strings no longer than the maximum length. NEWLINE_CONSUME allows newlines to be included in strings instead of terminating them.
</para>
<para>REGEX specifies a regular expression that a string must match to be returned. Typical usage 
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  file(STRINGS myfile.txt myfile)
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>stores a list in the variable "myfile" in which each item is a line from the input file.
</para>
<para>GLOB will generate a list of all files that match the globbing expressions and store it into the variable. Globbing expressions are similar to regular expressions, but much simpler. If RELATIVE flag is specified for an expression, the results will be returned as a relative path to the given path.  (We do not recommend using GLOB to collect a list of source files from your source tree.  If no CMakeLists.txt file changes when a source is added or removed then the generated build system cannot know when to ask CMake to regenerate.)
</para>
<para>Examples of globbing expressions include:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   *.cxx      - match all files with extension cxx
   *.vt?      - match all files with extension vta,...,vtz
   f[3-5].txt - match files f3.txt, f4.txt, f5.txt
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>GLOB_RECURSE will generate a list similar to the regular GLOB, except it will traverse all the subdirectories of the matched directory and match the files. Subdirectories that are symlinks are only traversed if FOLLOW_SYMLINKS is given or cmake policy CMP0009 is not set to NEW. See cmake --help-policy CMP0009 for more information.
</para>
<para>Examples of recursive globbing include:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   /dir/*.py  - match all python files in /dir and subdirectories

</para>
<para>MAKE_DIRECTORY will create the given directories, also if their parent directories don't exist yet
</para>
<para>RENAME moves a file or directory within a filesystem, replacing the destination atomically.
</para>
<para>REMOVE will remove the given files, also in subdirectories
</para>
<para>REMOVE_RECURSE will remove the given files and directories, also non-empty directories
</para>
<para>RELATIVE_PATH will determine relative path from directory to the given file.
</para>
<para>TO_CMAKE_PATH will convert path into a cmake style path with unix /.  The input can be a single path or a system path like "$ENV{PATH}".  Note the double quotes around the ENV call TO_CMAKE_PATH only takes  one argument. This command will also convert the native list delimiters for a list of paths like the PATH environment variable.
</para>
<para>TO_NATIVE_PATH works just like TO_CMAKE_PATH, but will convert from  a cmake style path into the native path style \ for windows and / for UNIX.
</para>
<para>DOWNLOAD will download the given URL to the given file. If LOG var is specified a log of the download will be put in var. If STATUS var is specified the status of the operation will be put in var. The status is returned in a list of length 2. The first element is the numeric return value for the operation, and the second element is a string value for the error. A 0 numeric error means no error in the operation. If TIMEOUT time is specified, the operation will timeout after time seconds, time should be specified as an integer. The INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT specifies an integer number of seconds of inactivity after which the operation should terminate. If EXPECTED_HASH ALGO=value is specified, the operation will verify that the downloaded file's actual hash matches the expected value, where ALGO is one of MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, or SHA512.  If it does not match, the operation fails with an error. ("EXPECTED_MD5 sum" is short-hand for "EXPECTED_HASH MD5=sum".) If SHOW_PROGRESS is specified, progress information will be printed as status messages until the operation is complete. For https URLs CMake must be built with OpenSSL.  TLS/SSL certificates are not checked by default.  Set TLS_VERIFY to ON to check certificates and/or use EXPECTED_HASH to verify downloaded content.  Set TLS_CAINFO to specify a custom Certificate Authority file.  If either TLS option is not given CMake will check variables CMAKE_TLS_VERIFY and CMAKE_TLS_CAINFO, respectively.
</para>
<para>UPLOAD will upload the given file to the given URL. If LOG var is specified a log of the upload will be put in var. If STATUS var is specified the status of the operation will be put in var. The status is returned in a list of length 2. The first element is the numeric return value for the operation, and the second element is a string value for the error. A 0 numeric error means no error in the operation. If TIMEOUT time is specified, the operation will timeout after time seconds, time should be specified as an integer. The INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT specifies an integer number of seconds of inactivity after which the operation should terminate. If SHOW_PROGRESS is specified, progress information will be printed as status messages until the operation is complete.
</para>
<para>TIMESTAMP will write a string representation of the modification time of filename to variable.

<para>The file() command also provides COPY and INSTALL signatures:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  file(&lt;COPY|INSTALL&gt; files... DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;
       [FILE_PERMISSIONS permissions...]
       [DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS permissions...]
       [NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS] [USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS]
       [FILES_MATCHING]
       [[PATTERN &lt;pattern&gt; | REGEX &lt;regex&gt;]
        [EXCLUDE] [PERMISSIONS permissions...]] [...])
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>The COPY signature copies files, directories, and symlinks to a destination folder.  Relative input paths are evaluated with respect to the current source directory, and a relative destination is evaluated with respect to the current build directory.  Copying preserves input file timestamps, and optimizes out a file if it exists at the destination with the same timestamp.  Copying preserves input permissions unless explicit permissions or NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS are given (default is USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS).  See the install(DIRECTORY) command for documentation of permissions, PATTERN, REGEX, and EXCLUDE options.  
</para>
<para>The INSTALL signature differs slightly from COPY: it prints status messages, and NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS is default.  Installation scripts generated by the install() command use this signature (with some undocumented options for internal use).</para>

</para>
<para>This command is used to find a full path to named file. A cache entry named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the result of this command.  If the full path to a file is found the result is stored in the variable and the search will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared.  If nothing is found, the result will be &lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again the next time find_file is invoked with the same variable.  The name of the full path to a file that is searched for is specified by the names listed after the NAMES argument.   Additional search locations can be specified after the PATHS argument.  If ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section the environment variable var will be read and converted from a system environment variable to a cmake style list of paths.  For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the system path variable. The argument after DOC will be used for the documentation string in the cache.  PATH_SUFFIXES specifies additional subdirectories to check below each search path.

</para>
<para>The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or more directories to be prepended to all other search directories. This effectively "re-roots" the entire search under given locations. By default it is empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will search there too. By default at first the directories listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted directories will be searched. The default behavior can be adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE.  This behavior can be manually overridden on a per-call basis. By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted directories will be searched.

<para>Finds and loads settings from an external project.  &lt;package&gt;_FOUND will be set to indicate whether the package was found.  When the package is found package-specific information is provided through variables and imported targets documented by the package itself.  The QUIET option disables messages if the package cannot be found.  The MODULE option disables the second signature documented below.  The REQUIRED option stops processing with an error message if the package cannot be found.
</para>
<para>A package-specific list of required components may be listed after the COMPONENTS option (or after the REQUIRED option if present).  Additional optional components may be listed after OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS.  Available components and their influence on whether a package is considered to be found are defined by the target package.
</para>
<para>The [version] argument requests a version with which the package found should be compatible (format is major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]).  The EXACT option requests that the version be matched exactly.  If no [version] and/or component list is given to a recursive invocation inside a find-module, the corresponding arguments are forwarded automatically from the outer call (including the EXACT flag for [version]).  Version support is currently provided only on a package-by-package basis (details below).
</para>
<para>User code should generally look for packages using the above simple signature.  The remainder of this command documentation specifies the full command signature and details of the search process.  Project maintainers wishing to provide a package to be found by this command are encouraged to read on.
</para>
<para>The command has two modes by which it searches for packages: "Module" mode and "Config" mode.  Module mode is available when the command is invoked with the above reduced signature.  CMake searches for a file called "Find&lt;package&gt;.cmake" in the CMAKE_MODULE_PATH followed by the CMake installation.  If the file is found, it is read and processed by CMake.  It is responsible for finding the package, checking the version, and producing any needed messages.  Many find-modules provide limited or no support for versioning; check the module documentation.  If no module is found and the MODULE option is not given the command proceeds to Config mode.
</para>
<para>The complete Config mode command signature is:

</programlisting>
</para>
<para>The CONFIG option may be used to skip Module mode explicitly and switch to Config mode.  It is synonymous to using NO_MODULE.  Config mode is also implied by use of options not specified in the reduced signature.  
</para>
<para>Config mode attempts to locate a configuration file provided by the package to be found.  A cache entry called &lt;package&gt;_DIR is created to hold the directory containing the file.  By default the command searches for a package with the name &lt;package&gt;.  If the NAMES option is given the names following it are used instead of &lt;package&gt;.  The command searches for a file called "&lt;name&gt;Config.cmake" or "&lt;lower-case-name&gt;-config.cmake" for each name specified.  A replacement set of possible configuration file names may be given using the CONFIGS option.  The search procedure is specified below.  Once found, the configuration file is read and processed by CMake.  Since the file is provided by the package it already knows the location of package contents.  The full path to the configuration file is stored in the cmake variable &lt;package&gt;_CONFIG.
</para>
<para>All configuration files which have been considered by CMake while searching for an installation of the package with an appropriate version are stored in the cmake variable &lt;package&gt;_CONSIDERED_CONFIGS, the associated versions in &lt;package&gt;_CONSIDERED_VERSIONS. 
</para>
<para>If the package configuration file cannot be found CMake will generate an error describing the problem unless the QUIET argument is specified.  If REQUIRED is specified and the package is not found a fatal error is generated and the configure step stops executing.  If &lt;package&gt;_DIR has been set to a directory not containing a configuration file CMake will ignore it and search from scratch.
</para>
<para>When the [version] argument is given Config mode will only find a version of the package that claims compatibility with the requested version (format is major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]).  If the EXACT option is given only a version of the package claiming an exact match of the requested version may be found.  CMake does not establish any convention for the meaning of version numbers.  Package version numbers are checked by "version" files provided by the packages themselves.  For a candidate package configuration file "&lt;config-file&gt;.cmake" the corresponding version file is located next to it and named either "&lt;config-file&gt;-version.cmake" or "&lt;config-file&gt;Version.cmake".  If no such version file is available then the configuration file is assumed to not be compatible with any requested version.  A basic version file containing generic version matching code can be created using the macro write_basic_package_version_file(), see its documentation for more details.  When a version file is found it is loaded to check the requested version number.  The version file is loaded in a nested scope in which the following variables have been defined:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  PACKAGE_FIND_NAME          = the &lt;package&gt; name
  PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION       = full requested version string
  PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MAJOR = major version if requested, else 0
  PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if requested, else 0
  PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_PATCH = patch version if requested, else 0
  PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_TWEAK = tweak version if requested, else 0
  PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_COUNT = number of version components, 0 to 4
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>The version file checks whether it satisfies the requested version and sets these variables:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  PACKAGE_VERSION            = full provided version string
  PACKAGE_VERSION_EXACT      = true if version is exact match
  PACKAGE_VERSION_COMPATIBLE = true if version is compatible
  PACKAGE_VERSION_UNSUITABLE = true if unsuitable as any version
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>These variables are checked by the find_package command to determine whether the configuration file provides an acceptable version.  They are not available after the find_package call returns.  If the version is acceptable the following variables are set:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  &lt;package&gt;_VERSION       = full provided version string
  &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_MAJOR = major version if provided, else 0
  &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if provided, else 0
  &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_PATCH = patch version if provided, else 0
  &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_TWEAK = tweak version if provided, else 0
  &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_COUNT = number of version components, 0 to 4
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>and the corresponding package configuration file is loaded.  When multiple package configuration files are available whose version files claim compatibility with the version requested it is unspecified which one is chosen.  No attempt is made to choose a highest or closest version number.

</programlisting>
</para>
<para>In all cases the &lt;name&gt; is treated as case-insensitive and corresponds to any of the names specified (&lt;package&gt; or names given by NAMES).  Paths with lib/&lt;arch&gt; are enabled if CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set.  If PATH_SUFFIXES is specified the suffixes are appended to each (W) or (U) directory entry one-by-one.
</para>
<para>This set of directories is intended to work in cooperation with projects that provide configuration files in their installation trees.  Directories above marked with (W) are intended for installations on Windows where the prefix may point at the top of an application's installation directory.  Those marked with (U) are intended for installations on UNIX platforms where the prefix is shared by multiple packages.  This is merely a convention, so all (W) and (U) directories are still searched on all platforms.  Directories marked with (A) are intended for installations on Apple platforms.  The cmake variables CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK and CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE determine the order of preference as specified below.

</para>
<para>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the cmake variable    CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or one of the following:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   "FIRST"  - Try to find frameworks before standard
              libraries or headers. This is the default on Darwin.
   "LAST"   - Try to find frameworks after standard
              libraries or headers.
   "ONLY"   - Only try to find frameworks.
   "NEVER" - Never try to find frameworks.
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one of the following:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   "FIRST"  - Try to find application bundles before standard
              programs. This is the default on Darwin.
   "LAST"   - Try to find application bundles after standard
              programs.
   "ONLY"   - Only try to find application bundles.
   "NEVER" - Never try to find application bundles.
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or more directories to be prepended to all other search directories. This effectively "re-roots" the entire search under given locations. By default it is empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will search there too. By default at first the directories listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted directories will be searched. The default behavior can be adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE.  This behavior can be manually overridden on a per-call basis. By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted directories will be searched.
</para>
<para>The default search order is designed to be most-specific to least-specific for common use cases.  Projects may override the order by simply calling the command multiple times and using the NO_* options:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>   find_package(&lt;package&gt; PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
   find_package(&lt;package&gt;)
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search again.
</para>
<para>Every non-REQUIRED find_package() call can be disabled by setting the variable CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;package&gt; to TRUE. See the documentation for the CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;package&gt; variable for more information.
</para>
<para>When loading a find module or package configuration file find_package defines variables to provide information about the call arguments (and restores their original state before returning):
</para>
<para>
<programlisting> &lt;package&gt;_FIND_REQUIRED      = true if REQUIRED option was given
 &lt;package&gt;_FIND_QUIETLY       = true if QUIET option was given
 &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION       = full requested version string
 &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_MAJOR = major version if requested, else 0
 &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if requested, else 0
 &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_PATCH = patch version if requested, else 0
 &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_TWEAK = tweak version if requested, else 0
 &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_COUNT = number of version components, 0 to 4
 &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_EXACT = true if EXACT option was given
 &lt;package&gt;_FIND_COMPONENTS    = list of requested components
 &lt;package&gt;_FIND_REQUIRED_&lt;c&gt;  = true if component &lt;c&gt; is required
                                false if component &lt;c&gt; is optional
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>In Module mode the loaded find module is responsible to honor the request detailed by these variables; see the find module for details.  In Config mode find_package handles REQUIRED, QUIET, and version options automatically but leaves it to the package configuration file to handle components in a way that makes sense for the package.  The package configuration file may set &lt;package&gt;_FOUND to false to tell find_package that component requirements are not satisfied.

<para>This command is used to find a directory containing the named file. A cache entry named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the result of this command.  If the file in a directory is found the result is stored in the variable and the search will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared.  If nothing is found, the result will be &lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again the next time find_path is invoked with the same variable.  The name of the file in a directory that is searched for is specified by the names listed after the NAMES argument.   Additional search locations can be specified after the PATHS argument.  If ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section the environment variable var will be read and converted from a system environment variable to a cmake style list of paths.  For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the system path variable. The argument after DOC will be used for the documentation string in the cache.

By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted directories will be searched.

<para>The default search order is designed to be most-specific to least-specific for common use cases.  Projects may override the order by simply calling the command multiple times and using the NO_* options:

<para>This command is used to find a program. A cache entry named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the result of this command.  If the program is found the result is stored in the variable and the search will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared.  If nothing is found, the result will be &lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again the next time find_program is invoked with the same variable.  The name of the program that is searched for is specified by the names listed after the NAMES argument.   Additional search locations can be specified after the PATHS argument.  If ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section the environment variable var will be read and converted from a system environment variable to a cmake style list of paths.  For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the system path variable. The argument after DOC will be used for the documentation string in the cache.  PATH_SUFFIXES specifies additional subdirectories to check below each search path.
</para>
<para>If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional paths are added to the search. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not specified, the search process is as follows:
</para>

<para>The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or more directories to be prepended to all other search directories. This effectively "re-roots" the entire search under given locations. By default it is empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will search there too. By default at first the directories listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted directories will be searched. The default behavior can be adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM.  This behavior can be manually overridden on a per-call basis.

In addition to referencing the formal parameters you can reference the variable ARGC which will be set to the number of arguments passed into the function as well as ARGV0 ARGV1 ARGV2 ... which will have the actual values of the arguments passed in. This facilitates creating functions with optional arguments. Additionally ARGV holds the list of all arguments given to the function and ARGN holds the list of arguments past the last expected argument.

</para>
<para>The list subcommands APPEND, INSERT, REMOVE_AT, REMOVE_ITEM, REMOVE_DUPLICATES, REVERSE and SORT may create new values for the list within the current CMake variable scope. Similar to the SET command, the LIST command creates new variable values in the current scope, even if the list itself is actually defined in a parent scope. To propagate the results of these operations upwards, use SET with PARENT_SCOPE, SET with CACHE INTERNAL, or some other means of value propagation.
</para>
<para>NOTES: A list in cmake is a ; separated group of strings. To create a list the set command can be used. For example, set(var a b c d e)  creates a list with a;b;c;d;e, and set(var "a b c d e") creates a string or a list with one item in it.
</para>
<para>When specifying index values, if &lt;element index&gt; is 0 or greater, it is indexed from the beginning of the list, with 0 representing the first list element. If &lt;element index&gt; is -1 or lesser, it is indexed from the end of the list, with -1 representing the last list element. Be careful when counting with negative indices: they do not start from 0. -0 is equivalent to 0, the first list element.

</para>
<para>Define a macro named &lt;name&gt; that takes arguments named arg1 arg2 arg3 (...).  Commands listed after macro, but before the matching endmacro, are not invoked until the macro is invoked.  When it is invoked, the commands recorded in the macro are first modified by replacing formal parameters (${arg1}) with the arguments passed, and then invoked as normal commands. In addition to referencing the formal parameters you can reference the values ${ARGC} which will be set to the number of arguments passed into the function as well as ${ARGV0} ${ARGV1} ${ARGV2} ... which will have the actual values of the arguments passed in. This facilitates creating macros with optional arguments. Additionally ${ARGV} holds the list of all arguments given to the macro and ${ARGN} holds the list of arguments past the last expected argument. Note that the parameters to a macro and values such as ARGN are not variables in the usual CMake sense. They are string replacements much like the C preprocessor would do with a macro. If you want true CMake variables and/or better CMake scope control you should look at the function command.

<para>Normally, set(...CACHE...) creates cache variables, but does not modify them. If FORCE is specified, the value of the cache variable is set, even if the variable is already in the cache. This should normally be avoided, as it will remove any changes to the cache variable's value by the user.

<para>*** Variable types in CMake ***
</para>
<para>In CMake there are two types of variables: normal variables and cache variables. Normal variables are meant for the internal use of the script (just like variables in most programming languages); they are not persisted across CMake runs. Cache variables (unless set with INTERNAL) are mostly intended for configuration settings where the first CMake run determines a suitable default value, which the user can then override, by editing the cache with tools such as ccmake or cmake-gui. Cache variables are stored in the CMake cache file, and are persisted across CMake runs. 
</para>
<para>Both types can exist at the same time with the same name but different values. When ${FOO} is evaluated, CMake first looks for a normal variable 'FOO' in scope and uses it if set. If and only if no normal variable exists then it falls back to the cache variable 'FOO'.
</para>
<para>Some examples:
</para>
<para>The code 'set(FOO "x")' sets the normal variable 'FOO'. It does not touch the cache, but it will hide any existing cache value 'FOO'.
</para>
<para>The code 'set(FOO "x" CACHE ...)' checks for 'FOO' in the cache, ignoring any normal variable of the same name. If 'FOO' is in the cache then nothing happens to either the normal variable or the cache variable. If 'FOO' is not in the cache, then it is added to the cache.
</para>
<para>Finally, whenever a cache variable is added or modified by a command, CMake also *removes* the normal variable of the same name from the current scope so that an immediately following evaluation of it will expose the newly cached value.
</para>
<para>Normally projects should avoid using normal and cache variables of the same name, as this interaction can be hard to follow. However, in some situations it can be useful. One example (used by some projects):
</para>
<para>A project has a subproject in its source tree. The child project has its own CMakeLists.txt, which is included from the parent CMakeLists.txt using add_subdirectory(). Now, if the parent and the child project provide the same option (for example a compiler option), the parent gets the first chance to add a user-editable option to the cache. Normally, the child would then use the same value that the parent uses. However, it may be necessary to hard-code the value for the child project's option while still allowing the user to edit the value used by the parent project. The parent project can achieve this simply by setting a normal variable with the same name as the option in a scope sufficient to hide the option's cache variable from the child completely. The parent has already set the cache variable,  so the child's set(...CACHE...) will do nothing, and evaluating the option variable will use the value from the normal variable, which hides the cache variable.</para>

<title>ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS</title>
<abstract>
<para>Allow duplicate custom targets to be created.</para>
</abstract>
<para>Normally CMake requires that all targets built in a project have globally unique logical names (see policy CMP0002).  This is necessary to generate meaningful project file names in Xcode and VS IDE generators.  It also allows the target names to be referenced unambiguously.
</para>
<para>Makefile generators are capable of supporting duplicate custom target names.  For projects that care only about Makefile generators and do not wish to support Xcode or VS IDE generators, one may set this property to true to allow duplicate custom targets.  The property allows multiple add_custom_target command calls in different directories to specify the same target name.  However, setting this property will cause non-Makefile generators to produce an error and refuse to generate the project.</para>

<para>The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to a semicolon-separated list of preprocessor definitions using the syntax VAR or VAR=value.  Function-style definitions are not supported.  CMake will automatically escape the value correctly for the native build system (note that CMake language syntax may require escapes to specify some values).  This property may be set on a per-configuration basis using the name COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; where &lt;CONFIG&gt; is an upper-case name (ex. "COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG").

<para>CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported by the native build tool.  The VS6 IDE does not support definition values with spaces (but NMake does).

<para>Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping certain values.  CMake has work-arounds for many cases but some values may just not be possible to pass correctly.  If a value does not seem to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work-around the problem by adding escape sequences to the value.  Your work-around may break in a future version of CMake that has improved escape support.  Instead consider defining the macro in a (configured) header file.  Then report the limitation.

<para>Should the target be processed with automoc (for Qt projects).</para>
</abstract>
<para>AUTOMOC is a boolean specifying whether CMake will handle the Qt moc preprocessor automatically, i.e. without having to use the QT4_WRAP_CPP() or QT5_WRAP_CPP() macro. Currently Qt4 and Qt5 are supported.  When this property is set to TRUE, CMake will scan the source files at build time and invoke moc accordingly. If an #include statement like #include "moc_foo.cpp" is found, the Q_OBJECT class declaration is expected in the header, and moc is run on the header file. If an #include statement like #include "foo.moc" is found, then a Q_OBJECT is expected in the current source file and moc is run on the file itself. Additionally, all header files are parsed for Q_OBJECT macros, and if found, moc is also executed on those files. The resulting moc files, which are not included as shown above in any of the source files are included in a generated &lt;targetname&gt;_automoc.cpp file, which is compiled as part of the target.This property is initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_AUTOMOC if it is set when a target is created.

<para>Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping certain values.  CMake has work-arounds for many cases but some values may just not be possible to pass correctly.  If a value does not seem to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work-around the problem by adding escape sequences to the value.  Your work-around may break in a future version of CMake that has improved escape support.  Instead consider defining the macro in a (configured) header file.  Then report the limitation.

When this property is set to true CMake will allow other targets to "link" to the executable with the TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES command.  On all platforms a target-level dependency on the executable is created for targets that link to it.  For DLL platforms an import library will be created for the exported symbols and then used for linking.  All Windows-based systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms.  For non-DLL platforms that require all symbols to be resolved at link time, such as Mac OS X, the module will "link" to the executable using a flag like "-bundle_loader".  For other non-DLL platforms the link rule is simply ignored since the dynamic loader will automatically bind symbols when the module is loaded.  </para>

<para>Whether consumers need to create a position-independent target</para>
</abstract>
<para>The INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE property informs consumers of this target whether they must set their POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE property to ON.  If this property is set to ON, then the POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE property on all consumers will be set to ON.  Similarly, if this property is set to OFF, then the POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE property on all consumers will be set to OFF.  If this property is undefined, then consumers will determine their POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE property by other means.  Consumers must ensure that the targets that they link to have a consistent requirement for their INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE property.</para>

<para>For a non-imported target, this property is provided for compatibility with CMake 2.4 and below.  It was meant to get the location of an executable target's output file for use in add_custom_command.  The path may contain a build-system-specific portion that is replaced at build time with the configuration getting built (such as "$(ConfigurationName)" in VS). In CMake 2.6 and above add_custom_command automatically recognizes a target name in its COMMAND and DEPENDS options and computes the target location.  In CMake 2.8.4 and above add_custom_command recognizes generator expressions to refer to target locations anywhere in the command.  Therefore this property is not needed for creating custom commands.

</abstract>
<para>If find_package is called without an explicit mode option (MODULE, CONFIG or NO_MODULE) and no Find&lt;pkg&gt;.cmake module is in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH then CMake implicitly assumes that the caller intends to search for a package configuration file.  If no package configuration file is found then the wording of the failure message must account for both the case that the package is really missing and the case that the project has a bug and failed to provide the intended Find module.  If instead the caller specifies an explicit mode option then the failure message can be more specific.
</para>
<para>Set CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_WARN_NO_MODULE to TRUE to tell find_package to warn when it implicitly assumes Config mode.  This helps developers enforce use of an explicit mode in all calls to find_package within a project.</para>

<para>Specifies directories to be ignored by searches in FIND_XXX() commands.  This is useful in cross-compiled environments where some system directories contain incompatible but possibly linkable libraries. For example, on cross-compiled cluster environments, this allows a user to ignore directories containing libraries meant for the front-end machine that modules like FindX11 (and others) would normally search. By default this is empty; it is intended to be set by the project. Note that CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH takes a list of directory names, NOT a list of prefixes. If you want to ignore paths under prefixes (bin, include, lib, etc.), you'll need to specify them explicitly.

<para>Install directory used by install.</para>
</abstract>
<para>If "make install" is invoked or INSTALL is built, this directory is pre-pended onto all install directories. This variable defaults to /usr/local on UNIX and c:/Program Files on Windows.
</para>
<para>On UNIX one can use the DESTDIR mechanism in order to relocate the whole installation. DESTDIR means DESTination DIRectory. It is commonly used by makefile users in order to install software at non-default location. It is usually invoked like this:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting> make DESTDIR=/home/john install
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>which will install the concerned software using the installation prefix, e.g. "/usr/local" pre-pended with the DESTDIR value which finally gives "/home/john/usr/local".
</para>
<para>WARNING: DESTDIR may not be used on Windows because installation prefix usually contains a drive letter like in "C:/Program Files" which cannot be pre-pended with some other prefix.</para>

<para>Specify a CMake file that overrides platform information.</para>
</abstract>
<para>CMake loads the specified file while enabling support for each language from either the project() or enable_language() commands.  It is loaded after CMake's builtin compiler and platform information modules have been loaded but before the information is used.  The file may set platform information variables to override CMake's defaults.
</para>
<para>This feature is intended for use only in overriding information variables that must be set before CMake builds its first test project to check that the compiler for a language works.  It should not be used to load a file in cases that a normal include() will work.  Use it only as a last resort for behavior that cannot be achieved any other way.  For example, one may set CMAKE_C_FLAGS_INIT to change the default value used to initialize CMAKE_C_FLAGS before it is cached.  The override file should NOT be used to set anything that could be set after languages are enabled, such as variables like CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY that affect the placement of binaries.  Information set in the file will be used for try_compile and try_run builds too.</para>

<para>CMake computes for every source file an object file name that is unique to the source file and deterministic with respect to the full path to the source file.  This allows multiple source files in a target to share the same name if they lie in different directories without rebuilding when one is added or removed.  However, it can produce long full paths in a few cases, so CMake shortens the path using a hashing scheme when the full path to an object file exceeds a limit.  CMake has a built-in limit for each platform that is sufficient for common tools, but some native tools may have a lower limit.  This variable may be set to specify the limit explicitly.

<sect2 id="cpack.variable.CPACK_SET_DESTDIR">
<title>CPACK_SET_DESTDIR</title>
<abstract>
<para>Boolean toggle to make CPack use DESTDIR mechanism when packaging.</para>
</abstract>
<para>DESTDIR means DESTination DIRectory. It is commonly used by makefile users in order to install software at non-default location. It is a basic relocation mechanism that should not be used on Windows (see CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX documentation). It is usually invoked like this:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting> make DESTDIR=/home/john install
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>which will install the concerned software using the installation prefix, e.g. "/usr/local" pre-pended with the DESTDIR value which finally gives "/home/john/usr/local". When preparing a package, CPack first installs the items to be packaged in a local (to the build tree) directory by using the same DESTDIR mechanism. Nevertheless, if CPACK_SET_DESTDIR is set then CPack will set DESTDIR before doing the local install. The most noticeable difference is that without CPACK_SET_DESTDIR, CPack uses CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX as a prefix whereas with CPACK_SET_DESTDIR set, CPack will use CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX as a prefix.
</para>
<para>Manually setting CPACK_SET_DESTDIR may help (or simply be necessary) if some install rules uses absolute DESTINATION (see CMake INSTALL command). However, starting with CPack/CMake 2.8.3 RPM and DEB installers tries to handle DESTDIR automatically so that it is seldom necessary for the user to set it.</para>

<para>Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when building executables etc on systems that use RPATH. When the software is installed the executables etc are relinked by CMake to have the install RPATH. If this variable is set to true then the software is always installed without RPATH, even if RPATH is enabled when building.  This can be useful for example to allow running tests from the build directory with RPATH enabled before the installation step.  To omit RPATH in both the build and install steps, use CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH instead.</para>

<sect2 id="cpack.variable.CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR">
<title>CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR</title>
<abstract>
<para>Build-time reference to per-configuration output subdirectory.</para>
</abstract>
<para>For native build systems supporting multiple configurations in the build tree (such as Visual Studio and Xcode), the value is a reference to a build-time variable specifying the name of the per-configuration output subdirectory.  On Makefile generators this evaluates to "." because there is only one configuration in a build tree.  Example values:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  $(IntDir)        = Visual Studio 6
  $(OutDir)        = Visual Studio 7, 8, 9
  $(Configuration) = Visual Studio 10
  $(CONFIGURATION) = Xcode
  .                = Make-based tools
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>Since these values are evaluated by the native build system, this variable is suitable only for use in command lines that will be evaluated at build time.  Example of intended usage:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>  add_executable(mytool mytool.c)
  add_custom_command(
    OUTPUT out.txt
    COMMAND ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool
            ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/in.txt out.txt
    DEPENDS mytool in.txt
    )
  add_custom_target(drive ALL DEPENDS out.txt)
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>Note that CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR is no longer necessary for this purpose but has been left for compatibility with existing projects.  Instead add_custom_command() recognizes executable target names in its COMMAND option, so "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool" can be replaced by just "mytool".
</para>
<para>This variable is read-only.  Setting it is undefined behavior.  In multi-configuration build systems the value of this variable is passed as the value of preprocessor symbol "CMAKE_INTDIR" to the compilation of all source files.</para>
