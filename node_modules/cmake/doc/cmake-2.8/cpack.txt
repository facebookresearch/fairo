cpack version 2.8.11.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name

  cpack - Packaging driver provided by CMake.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage

  cpack -G <generator> [options]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description

The "cpack" executable is the CMake packaging program.  CMake-generated build
trees created for projects that use the INSTALL_* commands have packaging
support.  This program will generate the package.

CMake is a cross-platform build system generator.  Projects specify their
build process with platform-independent CMake listfiles included in each
directory of a source tree with the name CMakeLists.txt.  Users build a
project by using CMake to generate a build system for a native tool on their
platform.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Options

  -G <generator>
       Use the specified generator to generate package.

       CPack may support multiple native packaging systems on certain
       platforms.  A generator is responsible for generating input files for
       particular system and invoking that systems.  Possible generator names
       are specified in the Generators section.

  -C <Configuration>
       Specify the project configuration

       This option specifies the configuration that the project was build
       with, for example 'Debug', 'Release'.

  -D <var>=<value>
       Set a CPack variable.

       Set a variable that can be used by the generator.

  --config <config file>
       Specify the config file.

       Specify the config file to use to create the package.  By default
       CPackConfig.cmake in the current directory will be used.

  --verbose,-V
       enable verbose output

       Run cpack with verbose output.

  --debug
       enable debug output (for CPack developers)

       Run cpack with debug output (for CPack developers).

  -P <package name>
       override/define CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME

       If the package name is not specified on cpack commmand line
       thenCPack.cmake defines it as CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME

  -R <package version>
       override/define CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION

       If version is not specified on cpack command line thenCPack.cmake
       defines it from CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_[MAJOR|MINOR|PATCH]look into
       CPack.cmake for detail

  -B <package directory>
       override/define CPACK_PACKAGE_DIRECTORY

       The directory where CPack will be doing its packaging work.The
       resulting package will be found there.  Inside this directoryCPack
       creates '_CPack_Packages' sub-directory which is theCPack temporary
       directory.

  --vendor <vendor name>
       override/define CPACK_PACKAGE_VENDOR

       If vendor is not specified on cpack command line (or inside
       CMakeLists.txt) thenCPack.cmake defines it with a default value

Commands

  cpack_add_component
       Describes a CPack installation component named by the COMPONENT
       argument to a CMake INSTALL command.

         cpack_add_component(compname
                             [DISPLAY_NAME name]
                             [DESCRIPTION description]
                             [HIDDEN | REQUIRED | DISABLED ]
                             [GROUP group]
                             [DEPENDS comp1 comp2 ... ]
                             [INSTALL_TYPES type1 type2 ... ]
                             [DOWNLOADED]
                             [ARCHIVE_FILE filename])

       

       The cmake_add_component command describes an installation component,
       which the user can opt to install or remove as part of the graphical
       installation process.  compname is the name of the component, as
       provided to the COMPONENT argument of one or more CMake INSTALL
       commands.

       DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the component, used in graphical
       installers to display the component name.  This value can be any
       string.

       DESCRIPTION is an extended description of the component, used in
       graphical installers to give the user additional information about the
       component.  Descriptions can span multiple lines using "\n" as the
       line separator.  Typically, these descriptions should be no more than
       a few lines long.

       HIDDEN indicates that this component will be hidden in the graphical
       installer, so that the user cannot directly change whether it is
       installed or not.

       REQUIRED indicates that this component is required, and therefore will
       always be installed.  It will be visible in the graphical installer,
       but it cannot be unselected.  (Typically, required components are
       shown greyed out).

       DISABLED indicates that this component should be disabled (unselected)
       by default.  The user is free to select this component for
       installation, unless it is also HIDDEN.

       DEPENDS lists the components on which this component depends.  If this
       component is selected, then each of the components listed must also be
       selected.  The dependency information is encoded within the installer
       itself, so that users cannot install inconsistent sets of components.

       GROUP names the component group of which this component is a part.  If
       not provided, the component will be a standalone component, not part
       of any component group.  Component groups are described with the
       cpack_add_component_group command, detailed below.

       INSTALL_TYPES lists the installation types of which this component is
       a part.  When one of these installations types is selected, this
       component will automatically be selected.  Installation types are
       described with the cpack_add_install_type command, detailed below.

       DOWNLOADED indicates that this component should be downloaded
       on-the-fly by the installer, rather than packaged in with the
       installer itself.  For more information, see the
       cpack_configure_downloads command.

       ARCHIVE_FILE provides a name for the archive file created by CPack to
       be used for downloaded components.  If not supplied, CPack will create
       a file with some name based on CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME and the name of
       the component.  See cpack_configure_downloads for more information.

  cpack_add_component_group
       Describes a group of related CPack installation components.

         cpack_add_component_group(groupname
                                  [DISPLAY_NAME name]
                                  [DESCRIPTION description]
                                  [PARENT_GROUP parent]
                                  [EXPANDED]
                                  [BOLD_TITLE])

       

       The cpack_add_component_group describes a group of installation
       components, which will be placed together within the listing of
       options.  Typically, component groups allow the user to
       select/deselect all of the components within a single group via a
       single group-level option.  Use component groups to reduce the
       complexity of installers with many options.  groupname is an arbitrary
       name used to identify the group in the GROUP argument of the
       cpack_add_component command, which is used to place a component in a
       group.  The name of the group must not conflict with the name of any
       component.

       DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the component group, used in
       graphical installers to display the component group name.  This value
       can be any string.

       DESCRIPTION is an extended description of the component group, used in
       graphical installers to give the user additional information about the
       components within that group.  Descriptions can span multiple lines
       using "\n" as the line separator.  Typically, these descriptions
       should be no more than a few lines long.

       PARENT_GROUP, if supplied, names the parent group of this group.
       Parent groups are used to establish a hierarchy of groups, providing
       an arbitrary hierarchy of groups.

       EXPANDED indicates that, by default, the group should show up as
       "expanded", so that the user immediately sees all of the components
       within the group.  Otherwise, the group will initially show up as a
       single entry.

       BOLD_TITLE indicates that the group title should appear in bold, to
       call the user's attention to the group.

  cpack_add_install_type
       Add a new installation type containing a set of predefined component
       selections to the graphical installer.

         cpack_add_install_type(typename
                                [DISPLAY_NAME name])

       

       The cpack_add_install_type command identifies a set of preselected
       components that represents a common use case for an application.  For
       example, a "Developer" install type might include an application along
       with its header and library files, while an "End user" install type
       might just include the application's executable.  Each component
       identifies itself with one or more install types via the INSTALL_TYPES
       argument to cpack_add_component.

       DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the install type, which will
       typically show up in a drop-down box within a graphical installer.
       This value can be any string.

  cpack_configure_downloads
       Configure CPack to download selected components on-the-fly as part of
       the installation process.

         cpack_configure_downloads(site
                                   [UPLOAD_DIRECTORY dirname]
                                   [ALL]
                                   [ADD_REMOVE|NO_ADD_REMOVE])

       

       The cpack_configure_downloads command configures installation-time
       downloads of selected components.  For each downloadable component,
       CPack will create an archive containing the contents of that
       component, which should be uploaded to the given site.  When the user
       selects that component for installation, the installer will download
       and extract the component in place.  This feature is useful for
       creating small installers that only download the requested components,
       saving bandwidth.  Additionally, the installers are small enough that
       they will be installed as part of the normal installation process, and
       the "Change" button in Windows Add/Remove Programs control panel will
       allow one to add or remove parts of the application after the original
       installation.  On Windows, the downloaded-components functionality
       requires the ZipDLL plug-in for NSIS, available at:

         http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ZipDLL_plug-in

       

       On Mac OS X, installers that download components on-the-fly can only
       be built and installed on system using Mac OS X 10.5 or later.

       The site argument is a URL where the archives for downloadable
       components will reside, e.g.,
       http://www.cmake.org/files/2.6.1/installer/ All of the archives
       produced by CPack should be uploaded to that location.

       UPLOAD_DIRECTORY is the local directory where CPack will create the
       various archives for each of the components.  The contents of this
       directory should be uploaded to a location accessible by the URL given
       in the site argument.  If omitted, CPack will use the directory
       CPackUploads inside the CMake binary directory to store the generated
       archives.

       The ALL flag indicates that all components be downloaded.  Otherwise,
       only those components explicitly marked as DOWNLOADED or that have a
       specified ARCHIVE_FILE will be downloaded.  Additionally, the ALL
       option implies ADD_REMOVE (unless NO_ADD_REMOVE is specified).

       ADD_REMOVE indicates that CPack should install a copy of the installer
       that can be called from Windows' Add/Remove Programs dialog (via the
       "Modify" button) to change the set of installed components.
       NO_ADD_REMOVE turns off this behavior.  This option is ignored on Mac
       OS X.

  break
       Break from an enclosing foreach or while loop.

         break()

       Breaks from an enclosing foreach loop or while loop

  cmake_minimum_required
       Set the minimum required version of cmake for a project.

         cmake_minimum_required(VERSION major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]
                                [FATAL_ERROR])

       If the current version of CMake is lower than that required it will
       stop processing the project and report an error.  When a version
       higher than 2.4 is specified the command implicitly invokes

         cmake_policy(VERSION major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]])

       which sets the cmake policy version level to the version specified.
       When version 2.4 or lower is given the command implicitly invokes

         cmake_policy(VERSION 2.4)

       which enables compatibility features for CMake 2.4 and lower.

       The FATAL_ERROR option is accepted but ignored by CMake 2.6 and
       higher.  It should be specified so CMake versions 2.4 and lower fail
       with an error instead of just a warning.

  cmake_policy
       Manage CMake Policy settings.

       As CMake evolves it is sometimes necessary to change existing behavior
       in order to fix bugs or improve implementations of existing features.
       The CMake Policy mechanism is designed to help keep existing projects
       building as new versions of CMake introduce changes in behavior.  Each
       new policy (behavioral change) is given an identifier of the form
       "CMP<NNNN>" where "<NNNN>" is an integer index.  Documentation
       associated with each policy describes the OLD and NEW behavior and the
       reason the policy was introduced.  Projects may set each policy to
       select the desired behavior.  When CMake needs to know which behavior
       to use it checks for a setting specified by the project.  If no
       setting is available the OLD behavior is assumed and a warning is
       produced requesting that the policy be set.

       The cmake_policy command is used to set policies to OLD or NEW
       behavior.  While setting policies individually is supported, we
       encourage projects to set policies based on CMake versions.

         cmake_policy(VERSION major.minor[.patch[.tweak]])

       Specify that the current CMake list file is written for the given
       version of CMake.  All policies introduced in the specified version or
       earlier will be set to use NEW behavior.  All policies introduced
       after the specified version will be unset (unless variable
       CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP<NNNN> sets a default).  This effectively
       requests behavior preferred as of a given CMake version and tells
       newer CMake versions to warn about their new policies.  The policy
       version specified must be at least 2.4 or the command will report an
       error.  In order to get compatibility features supporting versions
       earlier than 2.4 see documentation of policy CMP0001.

         cmake_policy(SET CMP<NNNN> NEW)
         cmake_policy(SET CMP<NNNN> OLD)

       Tell CMake to use the OLD or NEW behavior for a given policy.
       Projects depending on the old behavior of a given policy may silence a
       policy warning by setting the policy state to OLD.  Alternatively one
       may fix the project to work with the new behavior and set the policy
       state to NEW.

         cmake_policy(GET CMP<NNNN> <variable>)

       Check whether a given policy is set to OLD or NEW behavior.  The
       output variable value will be "OLD" or "NEW" if the policy is set, and
       empty otherwise.

       CMake keeps policy settings on a stack, so changes made by the
       cmake_policy command affect only the top of the stack.  A new entry on
       the policy stack is managed automatically for each subdirectory to
       protect its parents and siblings.  CMake also manages a new entry for
       scripts loaded by include() and find_package() commands except when
       invoked with the NO_POLICY_SCOPE option (see also policy CMP0011).
       The cmake_policy command provides an interface to manage custom
       entries on the policy stack:

         cmake_policy(PUSH)
         cmake_policy(POP)

       Each PUSH must have a matching POP to erase any changes.  This is
       useful to make temporary changes to policy settings.

       Functions and macros record policy settings when they are created and
       use the pre-record policies when they are invoked.  If the function or
       macro implementation sets policies, the changes automatically
       propagate up through callers until they reach the closest nested
       policy stack entry.

  configure_file
       Copy a file to another location and modify its contents.

         configure_file(<input> <output>
                        [COPYONLY] [ESCAPE_QUOTES] [@ONLY] 
                        [NEWLINE_STYLE [UNIX|DOS|WIN32|LF|CRLF] ])

       Copies a file <input> to file <output> and substitutes variable values
       referenced in the file content.  If <input> is a relative path it is
       evaluated with respect to the current source directory.  The <input>
       must be a file, not a directory.  If <output> is a relative path it is
       evaluated with respect to the current binary directory.  If <output>
       names an existing directory the input file is placed in that directory
       with its original name.

       If the <input> file is modified the build system will re-run CMake to
       re-configure the file and generate the build system again.

       This command replaces any variables in the input file referenced as
       ${VAR} or @VAR@ with their values as determined by CMake.  If a
       variable is not defined, it will be replaced with nothing.  If
       COPYONLY is specified, then no variable expansion will take place.  If
       ESCAPE_QUOTES is specified then any substituted quotes will be C-style
       escaped.  The file will be configured with the current values of CMake
       variables.  If @ONLY is specified, only variables of the form @VAR@
       will be replaced and ${VAR} will be ignored.  This is useful for
       configuring scripts that use ${VAR}.

       Input file lines of the form "#cmakedefine VAR ..." will be replaced
       with either "#define VAR ..." or "/* #undef VAR */" depending on
       whether VAR is set in CMake to any value not considered a false
       constant by the if() command.  (Content of "...", if any, is processed
       as above.) Input file lines of the form "#cmakedefine01 VAR" will be
       replaced with either "#define VAR 1" or "#define VAR 0" similarly.

       With NEWLINE_STYLE the line ending could be adjusted:

           'UNIX' or 'LF' for \n, 'DOS', 'WIN32' or 'CRLF' for \r\n.

       COPYONLY must not be used with NEWLINE_STYLE.

                         [ERROR_VARIABLE <variable>]
                         [INPUT_FILE <file>]
                         [OUTPUT_FILE <file>]
                         [ERROR_FILE <file>]
                         [OUTPUT_QUIET]
                         [ERROR_QUIET]
                         [OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE]
                         [ERROR_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE])

       Runs the given sequence of one or more commands with the standard
       output of each process piped to the standard input of the next.  A
       single standard error pipe is used for all processes.  If
       WORKING_DIRECTORY is given the named directory will be set as the
       current working directory of the child processes.  If TIMEOUT is given
       the child processes will be terminated if they do not finish in the
       specified number of seconds (fractions are allowed).  If
       RESULT_VARIABLE is given the variable will be set to contain the
       result of running the processes.  This will be an integer return code
       from the last child or a string describing an error condition.  If
       OUTPUT_VARIABLE or ERROR_VARIABLE are given the variable named will be
       set with the contents of the standard output and standard error pipes
       respectively.  If the same variable is named for both pipes their
       output will be merged in the order produced.  If INPUT_FILE,
       OUTPUT_FILE, or ERROR_FILE is given the file named will be attached to
       the standard input of the first process, standard output of the last
       process, or standard error of all processes respectively.  If
       OUTPUT_QUIET or ERROR_QUIET is given then the standard output or
       standard error results will be quietly ignored.  If more than one
       OUTPUT_* or ERROR_* option is given for the same pipe the precedence
       is not specified.  If no OUTPUT_* or ERROR_* options are given the
       output will be shared with the corresponding pipes of the CMake
       process itself.

       The execute_process command is a newer more powerful version of
       exec_program, but the old command has been kept for compatibility.

  file
       File manipulation command.

         file(WRITE filename "message to write"... )
         file(APPEND filename "message to write"... )
         file(READ filename variable [LIMIT numBytes] [OFFSET offset] [HEX])
         file(<MD5|SHA1|SHA224|SHA256|SHA384|SHA512> filename variable)
         file(STRINGS filename variable [LIMIT_COUNT num]
              [LIMIT_INPUT numBytes] [LIMIT_OUTPUT numBytes]
              [LENGTH_MINIMUM numBytes] [LENGTH_MAXIMUM numBytes]
              [NEWLINE_CONSUME] [REGEX regex]
              [NO_HEX_CONVERSION])
         file(GLOB variable [RELATIVE path] [globbing expressions]...)
         file(GLOB_RECURSE variable [RELATIVE path] 
              [FOLLOW_SYMLINKS] [globbing expressions]...)
         file(RENAME <oldname> <newname>)
         file(REMOVE [file1 ...])
         file(REMOVE_RECURSE [file1 ...])
         file(MAKE_DIRECTORY [directory1 directory2 ...])
         file(RELATIVE_PATH variable directory file)
         file(TO_CMAKE_PATH path result)
         file(TO_NATIVE_PATH path result)
         file(DOWNLOAD url file [INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT timeout]
              [TIMEOUT timeout] [STATUS status] [LOG log] [SHOW_PROGRESS]
              [EXPECTED_HASH ALGO=value] [EXPECTED_MD5 sum]
              [TLS_VERIFY on|off] [TLS_CAINFO file])
         file(UPLOAD filename url [INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT timeout]
              [TIMEOUT timeout] [STATUS status] [LOG log] [SHOW_PROGRESS])
         file(TIMESTAMP filename variable [<format string>] [UTC])

       WRITE will write a message into a file called 'filename'.  It
       overwrites the file if it already exists, and creates the file if it
       does not exist.  (If the file is a build input, use configure_file to
       update the file only when its content changes.)

       APPEND will write a message into a file same as WRITE, except it will
       append it to the end of the file

       READ will read the content of a file and store it into the variable.
       It will start at the given offset and read up to numBytes.  If the
       argument HEX is given, the binary data will be converted to
       hexadecimal representation and this will be stored in the variable.

       MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 will compute a
       cryptographic hash of the content of a file.

       STRINGS will parse a list of ASCII strings from a file and store it in
       a variable.  Binary data in the file are ignored.  Carriage return
       (CR) characters are ignored.  It works also for Intel Hex and Motorola
       S-record files, which are automatically converted to binary format
       when reading them.  Disable this using NO_HEX_CONVERSION.

       LIMIT_COUNT sets the maximum number of strings to return.  LIMIT_INPUT
       sets the maximum number of bytes to read from the input file.
       LIMIT_OUTPUT sets the maximum number of bytes to store in the output
       variable.  LENGTH_MINIMUM sets the minimum length of a string to
       return.  Shorter strings are ignored.  LENGTH_MAXIMUM sets the maximum
       length of a string to return.  Longer strings are split into strings
       no longer than the maximum length.  NEWLINE_CONSUME allows newlines to
       be included in strings instead of terminating them.

       REGEX specifies a regular expression that a string must match to be
       returned.  Typical usage

         file(STRINGS myfile.txt myfile)

       stores a list in the variable "myfile" in which each item is a line
       from the input file.

       GLOB will generate a list of all files that match the globbing
       expressions and store it into the variable.  Globbing expressions are
       similar to regular expressions, but much simpler.  If RELATIVE flag is
       specified for an expression, the results will be returned as a
       relative path to the given path.  (We do not recommend using GLOB to
       collect a list of source files from your source tree.  If no
       CMakeLists.txt file changes when a source is added or removed then the
       generated build system cannot know when to ask CMake to regenerate.)

       Examples of globbing expressions include:

          *.cxx      - match all files with extension cxx
          *.vt?      - match all files with extension vta,...,vtz
          f[3-5].txt - match files f3.txt, f4.txt, f5.txt

       GLOB_RECURSE will generate a list similar to the regular GLOB, except
       it will traverse all the subdirectories of the matched directory and
       match the files.  Subdirectories that are symlinks are only traversed
       if FOLLOW_SYMLINKS is given or cmake policy CMP0009 is not set to NEW.
       See cmake --help-policy CMP0009 for more information.

       Examples of recursive globbing include:

          /dir/*.py  - match all python files in /dir and subdirectories

       MAKE_DIRECTORY will create the given directories, also if their parent
       directories don't exist yet

       RENAME moves a file or directory within a filesystem, replacing the
       destination atomically.

       REMOVE will remove the given files, also in subdirectories

       REMOVE_RECURSE will remove the given files and directories, also
       non-empty directories

       RELATIVE_PATH will determine relative path from directory to the given
       file.

       TO_CMAKE_PATH will convert path into a cmake style path with unix /.
       The input can be a single path or a system path like "$ENV{PATH}".
       Note the double quotes around the ENV call TO_CMAKE_PATH only takes
       one argument.  This command will also convert the native list
       delimiters for a list of paths like the PATH environment variable.

       TO_NATIVE_PATH works just like TO_CMAKE_PATH, but will convert from a
       cmake style path into the native path style \ for windows and / for
       UNIX.

       DOWNLOAD will download the given URL to the given file.  If LOG var is
       specified a log of the download will be put in var.  If STATUS var is
       specified the status of the operation will be put in var.  The status
       is returned in a list of length 2.  The first element is the numeric
       return value for the operation, and the second element is a string
       value for the error.  A 0 numeric error means no error in the
       operation.  If TIMEOUT time is specified, the operation will timeout
       after time seconds, time should be specified as an integer.  The
       INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT specifies an integer number of seconds of
       inactivity after which the operation should terminate.  If
       EXPECTED_HASH ALGO=value is specified, the operation will verify that
       the downloaded file's actual hash matches the expected value, where
       ALGO is one of MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, or SHA512.  If it
       does not match, the operation fails with an error.  ("EXPECTED_MD5
       sum" is short-hand for "EXPECTED_HASH MD5=sum".) If SHOW_PROGRESS is
       specified, progress information will be printed as status messages
       until the operation is complete.  For https URLs CMake must be built
       with OpenSSL.  TLS/SSL certificates are not checked by default.  Set
       TLS_VERIFY to ON to check certificates and/or use EXPECTED_HASH to
       verify downloaded content.  Set TLS_CAINFO to specify a custom
       Certificate Authority file.  If either TLS option is not given CMake
       will check variables CMAKE_TLS_VERIFY and CMAKE_TLS_CAINFO,
       respectively.

       UPLOAD will upload the given file to the given URL.  If LOG var is
       specified a log of the upload will be put in var.  If STATUS var is
       specified the status of the operation will be put in var.  The status
       is returned in a list of length 2.  The first element is the numeric
       return value for the operation, and the second element is a string
       value for the error.  A 0 numeric error means no error in the
       operation.  If TIMEOUT time is specified, the operation will timeout
       after time seconds, time should be specified as an integer.  The
       INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT specifies an integer number of seconds of
       inactivity after which the operation should terminate.  If
       SHOW_PROGRESS is specified, progress information will be printed as
       status messages until the operation is complete.

       TIMESTAMP will write a string representation of the modification time
       of filename to variable.

       Should the command be unable to obtain a timestamp variable will be
       set to the empty string "".

       See documentation of the string TIMESTAMP sub-command for more
       details.

       The file() command also provides COPY and INSTALL signatures:

         file(<COPY|INSTALL> files... DESTINATION <dir>
              [FILE_PERMISSIONS permissions...]
              [DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS permissions...]
              [NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS] [USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS]
              [FILES_MATCHING]
              [[PATTERN <pattern> | REGEX <regex>]
               [EXCLUDE] [PERMISSIONS permissions...]] [...])

       The COPY signature copies files, directories, and symlinks to a
       destination folder.  Relative input paths are evaluated with respect
       to the current source directory, and a relative destination is
       evaluated with respect to the current build directory.  Copying
       preserves input file timestamps, and optimizes out a file if it exists
       at the destination with the same timestamp.  Copying preserves input
       permissions unless explicit permissions or NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS are
       given (default is USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS).  See the install(DIRECTORY)
       command for documentation of permissions, PATTERN, REGEX, and EXCLUDE
       options.

       The INSTALL signature differs slightly from COPY: it prints status
       messages, and NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS is default.  Installation scripts
       generated by the install() command use this signature (with some
       undocumented options for internal use).

  find_file
       Find the full path to a file.

          find_file(<VAR> name1 [path1 path2 ...])

       This is the short-hand signature for the command that is sufficient in
       many cases.  It is the same as find_file(<VAR> name1 [PATHS path1
       path2 ...])

          find_file(
                    <VAR>
                    name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
                    [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                    [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                    [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
                    [DOC "cache documentation string"]
                    [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
                    [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                    [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
                    [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                    [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
                    [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
                     ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
                     NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH]
                   )

       This command is used to find a full path to named file.  A cache entry
       named by <VAR> is created to store the result of this command.  If the
       full path to a file is found the result is stored in the variable and
       the search will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared.  If
       nothing is found, the result will be <VAR>-NOTFOUND, and the search
       will be attempted again the next time find_file is invoked with the
       same variable.  The name of the full path to a file that is searched
       for is specified by the names listed after the NAMES argument.
       Additional search locations can be specified after the PATHS argument.
       If ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section the environment
       variable var will be read and converted from a system environment
       variable to a cmake style list of paths.  For example ENV PATH would
       be a way to list the system path variable.  The argument after DOC
       will be used for the documentation string in the cache.  PATH_SUFFIXES
       specifies additional subdirectories to check below each search path.

       If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional paths are added to
       the search.  If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not specified, the search process
       is as follows:

       1.  Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache variables.  These
       are intended to be used on the command line with a -DVAR=value.  This
       can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is passed.

          <prefix>/include/<arch> if CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
          <prefix>/include for each <prefix> in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
          CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
          CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH

       2.  Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables.
       These are intended to be set in the user's shell configuration.  This
       can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.

          <prefix>/include/<arch> if CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
          <prefix>/include for each <prefix> in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
          CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
          CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH

       3.  Search the paths specified by the HINTS option.  These should be
       paths computed by system introspection, such as a hint provided by the
       location of another item already found.  Hard-coded guesses should be
       specified with the PATHS option.

       4.  Search the standard system environment variables.  This can be
       skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an argument.

          PATH
          INCLUDE

       5.  Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files for the
       current system.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is
       passed.

          <prefix>/include/<arch> if CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
          <prefix>/include for each <prefix> in CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
          CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
          CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH

       6.  Search the paths specified by the PATHS option or in the
       short-hand version of the command.  These are typically hard-coded
       guesses.

       On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the cmake variable
       CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or one of the following:

          "FIRST"  - Try to find frameworks before standard
                     libraries or headers. This is the default on Darwin.
          "LAST"   - Try to find frameworks after standard
                     libraries or headers.
          "ONLY"   - Only try to find frameworks.
          "NEVER" - Never try to find frameworks.

       On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application Bundles, the cmake
       variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one of the
       following:

          "FIRST"  - Try to find application bundles before standard
                     programs. This is the default on Darwin.
          "LAST"   - Try to find application bundles after standard
                     programs.
          "ONLY"   - Only try to find application bundles.
          "NEVER" - Never try to find application bundles.

       The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or more
       directories to be prepended to all other search directories.  This
       effectively "re-roots" the entire search under given locations.  By
       default it is empty.  It is especially useful when cross-compiling to
       point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will
       search there too.  By default at first the directories listed in
       CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted directories will be
       searched.  The default behavior can be adjusted by setting
       CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE.  This behavior can be manually
       overridden on a per-call basis.  By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH
       the search order will be as described above.  If
       NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be
       used.  If ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
       directories will be searched.

       The default search order is designed to be most-specific to
       least-specific for common use cases.  Projects may override the order
       by simply calling the command multiple times and using the NO_*
       options:

          find_file(<VAR> NAMES name PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
          find_file(<VAR> NAMES name)

       Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and
       stored in the cache so that no call will search again.

  find_library
       Find a library.

          find_library(<VAR> name1 [path1 path2 ...])

       This is the short-hand signature for the command that is sufficient in
       many cases.  It is the same as find_library(<VAR> name1 [PATHS path1
       path2 ...])

          find_library(
                    <VAR>
                    name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...] [NAMES_PER_DIR]
                    [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                    [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                    [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
                    [DOC "cache documentation string"]
                    [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
                    [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                    [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
                    [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                    [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
                    [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
                     ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
                     NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH]
                   )

       This command is used to find a library.  A cache entry named by <VAR>
       is created to store the result of this command.  If the library is
       found the result is stored in the variable and the search will not be
       repeated unless the variable is cleared.  If nothing is found, the
       result will be <VAR>-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again
       the next time find_library is invoked with the same variable.  The
       name of the library that is searched for is specified by the names
       listed after the NAMES argument.  Additional search locations can be
       specified after the PATHS argument.  If ENV var is found in the HINTS
       or PATHS section the environment variable var will be read and
       converted from a system environment variable to a cmake style list of
       paths.  For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the system path
       variable.  The argument after DOC will be used for the documentation
       string in the cache.  PATH_SUFFIXES specifies additional
       subdirectories to check below each search path.

       If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional paths are added to
       the search.  If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not specified, the search process
       is as follows:

       1.  Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache variables.  These
       are intended to be used on the command line with a -DVAR=value.  This
       can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is passed.

          <prefix>/lib/<arch> if CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
          <prefix>/lib for each <prefix> in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
          CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
          CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH

       2.  Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables.
       These are intended to be set in the user's shell configuration.  This
       can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.

          <prefix>/lib/<arch> if CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
          <prefix>/lib for each <prefix> in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
          CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
          CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH

       3.  Search the paths specified by the HINTS option.  These should be
       paths computed by system introspection, such as a hint provided by the
       location of another item already found.  Hard-coded guesses should be
       specified with the PATHS option.

       4.  Search the standard system environment variables.  This can be
       skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an argument.

          PATH
          LIB

       5.  Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files for the
       current system.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is
       passed.

          <prefix>/lib/<arch> if CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
          <prefix>/lib for each <prefix> in CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
          CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH
          CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH

       6.  Search the paths specified by the PATHS option or in the
       short-hand version of the command.  These are typically hard-coded
       guesses.

       On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the cmake variable
       CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or one of the following:

          "FIRST"  - Try to find frameworks before standard
                     libraries or headers. This is the default on Darwin.
          "LAST"   - Try to find frameworks after standard
                     libraries or headers.
          "ONLY"   - Only try to find frameworks.
          "NEVER" - Never try to find frameworks.

       On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application Bundles, the cmake
       variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one of the
       following:

          "FIRST"  - Try to find application bundles before standard
                     programs. This is the default on Darwin.
          "LAST"   - Try to find application bundles after standard
                     programs.
          "ONLY"   - Only try to find application bundles.
          "NEVER" - Never try to find application bundles.

       The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or more
       directories to be prepended to all other search directories.  This
       effectively "re-roots" the entire search under given locations.  By
       default it is empty.  It is especially useful when cross-compiling to
       point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will
       search there too.  By default at first the directories listed in
       CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted directories will be
       searched.  The default behavior can be adjusted by setting
       CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY.  This behavior can be manually
       overridden on a per-call basis.  By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH
       the search order will be as described above.  If
       NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be
       used.  If ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
       directories will be searched.

       The default search order is designed to be most-specific to
       least-specific for common use cases.  Projects may override the order
       by simply calling the command multiple times and using the NO_*
       options:

          find_library(<VAR> NAMES name PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
          find_library(<VAR> NAMES name)

       Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and
       stored in the cache so that no call will search again.

       When more than one value is given to the NAMES option this command by
       default will consider one name at a time and search every directory
       for it.  The NAMES_PER_DIR option tells this command to consider one
       directory at a time and search for all names in it.

       If the library found is a framework, then VAR will be set to the full
       path to the framework <fullPath>/A.framework.  When a full path to a
       framework is used as a library, CMake will use a -framework A, and a
       -F<fullPath> to link the framework to the target.

       If the global property FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS is set all search
       paths will be tested as normal, with "64/" appended, and with all
       matches of "lib/" replaced with "lib64/".  This property is
       automatically set for the platforms that are known to need it if at
       least one of the languages supported by the PROJECT command is
       enabled.

  find_package
       Load settings for an external project.

         find_package(<package> [version] [EXACT] [QUIET] [MODULE]
                      [REQUIRED] [[COMPONENTS] [components...]]
                      [OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS components...]
                      [NO_POLICY_SCOPE])

       Finds and loads settings from an external project.  <package>_FOUND
       will be set to indicate whether the package was found.  When the
       package is found package-specific information is provided through
       variables and imported targets documented by the package itself.  The
       QUIET option disables messages if the package cannot be found.  The
       MODULE option disables the second signature documented below.  The
       REQUIRED option stops processing with an error message if the package
       cannot be found.

       A package-specific list of required components may be listed after the
       COMPONENTS option (or after the REQUIRED option if present).
       Additional optional components may be listed after
       OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS.  Available components and their influence on
       whether a package is considered to be found are defined by the target
       package.

       The [version] argument requests a version with which the package found
       should be compatible (format is major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]).  The
       EXACT option requests that the version be matched exactly.  If no
       [version] and/or component list is given to a recursive invocation
       inside a find-module, the corresponding arguments are forwarded
       automatically from the outer call (including the EXACT flag for
       [version]).  Version support is currently provided only on a
       package-by-package basis (details below).

       User code should generally look for packages using the above simple
       signature.  The remainder of this command documentation specifies the
       full command signature and details of the search process.  Project
       maintainers wishing to provide a package to be found by this command
       are encouraged to read on.

       The command has two modes by which it searches for packages: "Module"
       mode and "Config" mode.  Module mode is available when the command is
       invoked with the above reduced signature.  CMake searches for a file
       called "Find<package>.cmake" in the CMAKE_MODULE_PATH followed by the
       CMake installation.  If the file is found, it is read and processed by
       CMake.  It is responsible for finding the package, checking the
       version, and producing any needed messages.  Many find-modules provide
       limited or no support for versioning; check the module documentation.
       If no module is found and the MODULE option is not given the command
       proceeds to Config mode.

       The complete Config mode command signature is:

         find_package(<package> [version] [EXACT] [QUIET]
                      [REQUIRED] [[COMPONENTS] [components...]]
                      [CONFIG|NO_MODULE]
                      [NO_POLICY_SCOPE]
                      [NAMES name1 [name2 ...]]
                      [CONFIGS config1 [config2 ...]]
                      [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ]]
                      [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ]]
                      [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
                      [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
                      [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                      [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
                      [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                      [NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY]
                      [NO_CMAKE_BUILDS_PATH]
                      [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
                      [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY]
                      [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
                       ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
                       NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH])

       The CONFIG option may be used to skip Module mode explicitly and
       switch to Config mode.  It is synonymous to using NO_MODULE.  Config
       mode is also implied by use of options not specified in the reduced
       signature.

       Config mode attempts to locate a configuration file provided by the
       package to be found.  A cache entry called <package>_DIR is created to
       hold the directory containing the file.  By default the command
       searches for a package with the name <package>.  If the NAMES option
       is given the names following it are used instead of <package>.  The
       command searches for a file called "<name>Config.cmake" or
       "<lower-case-name>-config.cmake" for each name specified.  A
       replacement set of possible configuration file names may be given
       using the CONFIGS option.  The search procedure is specified below.
       Once found, the configuration file is read and processed by CMake.
       Since the file is provided by the package it already knows the
       location of package contents.  The full path to the configuration file
       is stored in the cmake variable <package>_CONFIG.

       All configuration files which have been considered by CMake while
       searching for an installation of the package with an appropriate
       version are stored in the cmake variable <package>_CONSIDERED_CONFIGS,
       the associated versions in <package>_CONSIDERED_VERSIONS.

       If the package configuration file cannot be found CMake will generate
       an error describing the problem unless the QUIET argument is
       specified.  If REQUIRED is specified and the package is not found a
       fatal error is generated and the configure step stops executing.  If
       <package>_DIR has been set to a directory not containing a
       configuration file CMake will ignore it and search from scratch.

       When the [version] argument is given Config mode will only find a
       version of the package that claims compatibility with the requested
       version (format is major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]).  If the EXACT
       option is given only a version of the package claiming an exact match
       of the requested version may be found.  CMake does not establish any
       convention for the meaning of version numbers.  Package version
       numbers are checked by "version" files provided by the packages
       themselves.  For a candidate package configuration file
       "<config-file>.cmake" the corresponding version file is located next
       to it and named either "<config-file>-version.cmake" or
       "<config-file>Version.cmake".  If no such version file is available
       then the configuration file is assumed to not be compatible with any
       requested version.  A basic version file containing generic version
       matching code can be created using the macro
       write_basic_package_version_file(), see its documentation for more
       details.  When a version file is found it is loaded to check the
       requested version number.  The version file is loaded in a nested
       scope in which the following variables have been defined:

         PACKAGE_FIND_NAME          = the <package> name
         PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION       = full requested version string
         PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MAJOR = major version if requested, else 0
         PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if requested, else 0
         PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_PATCH = patch version if requested, else 0
         PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_TWEAK = tweak version if requested, else 0
         PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_COUNT = number of version components, 0 to 4

       The version file checks whether it satisfies the requested version and
       sets these variables:

         PACKAGE_VERSION            = full provided version string
         PACKAGE_VERSION_EXACT      = true if version is exact match
         PACKAGE_VERSION_COMPATIBLE = true if version is compatible
         PACKAGE_VERSION_UNSUITABLE = true if unsuitable as any version

       These variables are checked by the find_package command to determine
       whether the configuration file provides an acceptable version.  They
       are not available after the find_package call returns.  If the version
       is acceptable the following variables are set:

         <package>_VERSION       = full provided version string
         <package>_VERSION_MAJOR = major version if provided, else 0
         <package>_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if provided, else 0
         <package>_VERSION_PATCH = patch version if provided, else 0
         <package>_VERSION_TWEAK = tweak version if provided, else 0
         <package>_VERSION_COUNT = number of version components, 0 to 4

       and the corresponding package configuration file is loaded.  When
       multiple package configuration files are available whose version files
       claim compatibility with the version requested it is unspecified which
       one is chosen.  No attempt is made to choose a highest or closest
       version number.

       Config mode provides an elaborate interface and search procedure.
       Much of the interface is provided for completeness and for use
       internally by find-modules loaded by Module mode.  Most user code
       should simply call

         find_package(<package> [major[.minor]] [EXACT] [REQUIRED|QUIET])

       in order to find a package.  Package maintainers providing CMake
       package configuration files are encouraged to name and install them
       such that the procedure outlined below will find them without
       requiring use of additional options.

       CMake constructs a set of possible installation prefixes for the
       package.  Under each prefix several directories are searched for a
       configuration file.  The tables below show the directories searched.
       Each entry is meant for installation trees following Windows (W), UNIX
       (U), or Apple (A) conventions.

         <prefix>/                                               (W)
         <prefix>/(cmake|CMake)/                                 (W)
         <prefix>/<name>*/                                       (W)
         <prefix>/<name>*/(cmake|CMake)/                         (W)
         <prefix>/(lib/<arch>|lib|share)/cmake/<name>*/          (U)
         <prefix>/(lib/<arch>|lib|share)/<name>*/                (U)
         <prefix>/(lib/<arch>|lib|share)/<name>*/(cmake|CMake)/  (U)

       On systems supporting OS X Frameworks and Application Bundles the
       following directories are searched for frameworks or bundles
       containing a configuration file:

         <prefix>/<name>.framework/Resources/                    (A)
         <prefix>/<name>.framework/Resources/CMake/              (A)
         <prefix>/<name>.framework/Versions/*/Resources/         (A)
         <prefix>/<name>.framework/Versions/*/Resources/CMake/   (A)
         <prefix>/<name>.app/Contents/Resources/                 (A)
         <prefix>/<name>.app/Contents/Resources/CMake/           (A)

       In all cases the <name> is treated as case-insensitive and corresponds
       to any of the names specified (<package> or names given by NAMES).
       Paths with lib/<arch> are enabled if CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is
       set.  If PATH_SUFFIXES is specified the suffixes are appended to each
       (W) or (U) directory entry one-by-one.

       This set of directories is intended to work in cooperation with
       projects that provide configuration files in their installation trees.
       Directories above marked with (W) are intended for installations on
       Windows where the prefix may point at the top of an application's
       installation directory.  Those marked with (U) are intended for
       installations on UNIX platforms where the prefix is shared by multiple
       packages.  This is merely a convention, so all (W) and (U) directories
       are still searched on all platforms.  Directories marked with (A) are
       intended for installations on Apple platforms.  The cmake variables
       CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK and CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE determine the order of
       preference as specified below.

       The set of installation prefixes is constructed using the following
       steps.  If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified all NO_* options are enabled.

       1.  Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache variables.  These
       are intended to be used on the command line with a -DVAR=value.  This
       can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is passed.

          CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
          CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH
          CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH

       2.  Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables.
       These are intended to be set in the user's shell configuration.  This
       can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.

          <package>_DIR
          CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
          CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH
          CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH

       3.  Search paths specified by the HINTS option.  These should be paths
       computed by system introspection, such as a hint provided by the
       location of another item already found.  Hard-coded guesses should be
       specified with the PATHS option.

       4.  Search the standard system environment variables.  This can be
       skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.  Path entries ending
       in "/bin" or "/sbin" are automatically converted to their parent
       directories.

          PATH

       5.  Search project build trees recently configured in a CMake GUI.
       This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_BUILDS_PATH is passed.  It is intended
       for the case when a user is building multiple dependent projects one
       after another.

       6.  Search paths stored in the CMake user package registry.  This can
       be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY is passed.  On Windows a
       <package> may appear under registry key

         HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Kitware\CMake\Packages\<package>

       as a REG_SZ value, with arbitrary name, that specifies the directory
       containing the package configuration file.  On UNIX platforms a
       <package> may appear under the directory

         ~/.cmake/packages/<package>

       as a file, with arbitrary name, whose content specifies the directory
       containing the package configuration file.  See the export(PACKAGE)
       command to create user package registry entries for project build
       trees.

       7.  Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files for the
       current system.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is
       passed.

          CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
          CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH
          CMAKE_SYSTEM_APPBUNDLE_PATH

       8.  Search paths stored in the CMake system package registry.  This
       can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY is passed.  On
       Windows a <package> may appear under registry key

         HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Kitware\CMake\Packages\<package>

       as a REG_SZ value, with arbitrary name, that specifies the directory
       containing the package configuration file.  There is no system package
       registry on non-Windows platforms.

       9.  Search paths specified by the PATHS option.  These are typically
       hard-coded guesses.

       On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the cmake variable
       CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or one of the following:

          "FIRST"  - Try to find frameworks before standard
                     libraries or headers. This is the default on Darwin.
          "LAST"   - Try to find frameworks after standard
                     libraries or headers.
          "ONLY"   - Only try to find frameworks.
          "NEVER" - Never try to find frameworks.

       On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application Bundles, the cmake
       variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one of the
       following:

          "FIRST"  - Try to find application bundles before standard
                     programs. This is the default on Darwin.
          "LAST"   - Try to find application bundles after standard
                     programs.
          "ONLY"   - Only try to find application bundles.
          "NEVER" - Never try to find application bundles.

       The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or more
       directories to be prepended to all other search directories.  This
       effectively "re-roots" the entire search under given locations.  By
       default it is empty.  It is especially useful when cross-compiling to
       point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will
       search there too.  By default at first the directories listed in
       CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted directories will be
       searched.  The default behavior can be adjusted by setting
       CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE.  This behavior can be manually
       overridden on a per-call basis.  By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH
       the search order will be as described above.  If
       NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be
       used.  If ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
       directories will be searched.

       The default search order is designed to be most-specific to
       least-specific for common use cases.  Projects may override the order
       by simply calling the command multiple times and using the NO_*
       options:

          find_package(<package> PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
          find_package(<package>)

       Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and
       stored in the cache so that no call will search again.

       Every non-REQUIRED find_package() call can be disabled by setting the
       variable CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_<package> to TRUE.  See the
       documentation for the CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_<package> variable
       for more information.

       When loading a find module or package configuration file find_package
       defines variables to provide information about the call arguments (and
       restores their original state before returning):

        <package>_FIND_REQUIRED      = true if REQUIRED option was given
        <package>_FIND_QUIETLY       = true if QUIET option was given
        <package>_FIND_VERSION       = full requested version string
        <package>_FIND_VERSION_MAJOR = major version if requested, else 0
        <package>_FIND_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if requested, else 0
        <package>_FIND_VERSION_PATCH = patch version if requested, else 0
        <package>_FIND_VERSION_TWEAK = tweak version if requested, else 0
        <package>_FIND_VERSION_COUNT = number of version components, 0 to 4
        <package>_FIND_VERSION_EXACT = true if EXACT option was given
        <package>_FIND_COMPONENTS    = list of requested components
        <package>_FIND_REQUIRED_<c>  = true if component <c> is required
                                       false if component <c> is optional

       In Module mode the loaded find module is responsible to honor the
       request detailed by these variables; see the find module for details.
       In Config mode find_package handles REQUIRED, QUIET, and version
       options automatically but leaves it to the package configuration file
       to handle components in a way that makes sense for the package.  The
       package configuration file may set <package>_FOUND to false to tell
       find_package that component requirements are not satisfied.

       See the cmake_policy() command documentation for discussion of the
       NO_POLICY_SCOPE option.

  find_path
       Find the directory containing a file.

          find_path(<VAR> name1 [path1 path2 ...])

       This is the short-hand signature for the command that is sufficient in
       many cases.  It is the same as find_path(<VAR> name1 [PATHS path1
       path2 ...])

          find_path(
                    <VAR>
                    name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
                    [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                    [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                    [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
                    [DOC "cache documentation string"]
                    [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
                    [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                    [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
                    [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                    [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
                    [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
                     ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
                     NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH]
                   )

       This command is used to find a directory containing the named file.  A
       cache entry named by <VAR> is created to store the result of this
       command.  If the file in a directory is found the result is stored in
       the variable and the search will not be repeated unless the variable
       is cleared.  If nothing is found, the result will be <VAR>-NOTFOUND,
       and the search will be attempted again the next time find_path is
       invoked with the same variable.  The name of the file in a directory
       that is searched for is specified by the names listed after the NAMES
       argument.  Additional search locations can be specified after the
       PATHS argument.  If ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section the
       environment variable var will be read and converted from a system
       environment variable to a cmake style list of paths.  For example ENV
       PATH would be a way to list the system path variable.  The argument
       after DOC will be used for the documentation string in the cache.
       PATH_SUFFIXES specifies additional subdirectories to check below each
       search path.

       If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional paths are added to
       the search.  If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not specified, the search process
       is as follows:

       1.  Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache variables.  These
       are intended to be used on the command line with a -DVAR=value.  This
       can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is passed.

          <prefix>/include/<arch> if CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
          <prefix>/include for each <prefix> in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
          CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
          CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH

       2.  Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables.
       These are intended to be set in the user's shell configuration.  This
       can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.

          <prefix>/include/<arch> if CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
          <prefix>/include for each <prefix> in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
          CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
          CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH

       3.  Search the paths specified by the HINTS option.  These should be
       paths computed by system introspection, such as a hint provided by the
       location of another item already found.  Hard-coded guesses should be
       specified with the PATHS option.

       4.  Search the standard system environment variables.  This can be
       skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an argument.

          PATH
          INCLUDE

       5.  Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files for the
       current system.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is
       passed.

          <prefix>/include/<arch> if CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
          <prefix>/include for each <prefix> in CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
          CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
          CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH

       6.  Search the paths specified by the PATHS option or in the
       short-hand version of the command.  These are typically hard-coded
       guesses.

       On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the cmake variable
       CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or one of the following:

          "FIRST"  - Try to find frameworks before standard
                     libraries or headers. This is the default on Darwin.
          "LAST"   - Try to find frameworks after standard
                     libraries or headers.
          "ONLY"   - Only try to find frameworks.
          "NEVER" - Never try to find frameworks.

       On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application Bundles, the cmake
       variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one of the
       following:

          "FIRST"  - Try to find application bundles before standard
                     programs. This is the default on Darwin.
          "LAST"   - Try to find application bundles after standard
                     programs.
          "ONLY"   - Only try to find application bundles.
          "NEVER" - Never try to find application bundles.

       The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or more
       directories to be prepended to all other search directories.  This
       effectively "re-roots" the entire search under given locations.  By
       default it is empty.  It is especially useful when cross-compiling to
       point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will
       search there too.  By default at first the directories listed in
       CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted directories will be
       searched.  The default behavior can be adjusted by setting
       CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE.  This behavior can be manually
       overridden on a per-call basis.  By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH
       the search order will be as described above.  If
       NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be
       used.  If ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
       directories will be searched.

       The default search order is designed to be most-specific to
       least-specific for common use cases.  Projects may override the order
       by simply calling the command multiple times and using the NO_*
       options:

          find_path(<VAR> NAMES name PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
          find_path(<VAR> NAMES name)

       Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and
       stored in the cache so that no call will search again.

       When searching for frameworks, if the file is specified as A/b.h, then
       the framework search will look for A.framework/Headers/b.h.  If that
       is found the path will be set to the path to the framework.  CMake
       will convert this to the correct -F option to include the file.

  find_program
       Find an executable program.

          find_program(<VAR> name1 [path1 path2 ...])

       This is the short-hand signature for the command that is sufficient in
       many cases.  It is the same as find_program(<VAR> name1 [PATHS path1
       path2 ...])

          find_program(
                    <VAR>
                    name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
                    [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                    [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                    [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
                    [DOC "cache documentation string"]
                    [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
                    [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                    [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
                    [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                    [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
                    [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
                     ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
                     NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH]
                   )

       This command is used to find a program.  A cache entry named by <VAR>
       is created to store the result of this command.  If the program is
       found the result is stored in the variable and the search will not be
       repeated unless the variable is cleared.  If nothing is found, the
       result will be <VAR>-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again
       the next time find_program is invoked with the same variable.  The
       name of the program that is searched for is specified by the names
       listed after the NAMES argument.  Additional search locations can be
       specified after the PATHS argument.  If ENV var is found in the HINTS
       or PATHS section the environment variable var will be read and
       converted from a system environment variable to a cmake style list of
       paths.  For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the system path
       variable.  The argument after DOC will be used for the documentation
       string in the cache.  PATH_SUFFIXES specifies additional
       subdirectories to check below each search path.

       If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional paths are added to
       the search.  If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not specified, the search process
       is as follows:

       1.  Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache variables.  These
       are intended to be used on the command line with a -DVAR=value.  This
       can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is passed.

          <prefix>/[s]bin for each <prefix> in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
          CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH
          CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH

       2.  Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables.
       These are intended to be set in the user's shell configuration.  This
       can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.

          <prefix>/[s]bin for each <prefix> in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
          CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH
          CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH

       3.  Search the paths specified by the HINTS option.  These should be
       paths computed by system introspection, such as a hint provided by the
       location of another item already found.  Hard-coded guesses should be
       specified with the PATHS option.

       4.  Search the standard system environment variables.  This can be
       skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an argument.

          PATH
          

       5.  Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files for the
       current system.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is
       passed.

          <prefix>/[s]bin for each <prefix> in CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
          CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH
          CMAKE_SYSTEM_APPBUNDLE_PATH

       6.  Search the paths specified by the PATHS option or in the
       short-hand version of the command.  These are typically hard-coded
       guesses.

       On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the cmake variable
       CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or one of the following:

          "FIRST"  - Try to find frameworks before standard

          "LAST"   - Try to find frameworks after standard
                     libraries or headers.
          "ONLY"   - Only try to find frameworks.
          "NEVER" - Never try to find frameworks.

       On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application Bundles, the cmake
       variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one of the
       following:

          "FIRST"  - Try to find application bundles before standard
                     programs. This is the default on Darwin.
          "LAST"   - Try to find application bundles after standard
                     programs.
          "ONLY"   - Only try to find application bundles.
          "NEVER" - Never try to find application bundles.

       The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or more
       directories to be prepended to all other search directories.  This
       effectively "re-roots" the entire search under given locations.  By
       default it is empty.  It is especially useful when cross-compiling to
       point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will
       search there too.  By default at first the directories listed in
       CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted directories will be
       searched.  The default behavior can be adjusted by setting
       CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM.  This behavior can be manually
       overridden on a per-call basis.  By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH
       the search order will be as described above.  If
       NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be
       used.  If ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
       directories will be searched.

       The default search order is designed to be most-specific to
       least-specific for common use cases.  Projects may override the order
       by simply calling the command multiple times and using the NO_*
       options:

          find_program(<VAR> NAMES name PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
          find_program(<VAR> NAMES name)

       Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and
       stored in the cache so that no call will search again.

  foreach
       Evaluate a group of commands for each value in a list.

         foreach(loop_var arg1 arg2 ...)
           COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
           COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
           ...
         endforeach(loop_var)

       All commands between foreach and the matching endforeach are recorded
       without being invoked.  Once the endforeach is evaluated, the recorded
       list of commands is invoked once for each argument listed in the
       original foreach command.  Before each iteration of the loop
       "${loop_var}" will be set as a variable with the current value in the
       list.

         foreach(loop_var RANGE total)
         foreach(loop_var RANGE start stop [step])

       Foreach can also iterate over a generated range of numbers.  There are
       three types of this iteration:

       * When specifying single number, the range will have elements 0 to
       "total".

       * When specifying two numbers, the range will have elements from the
       first number to the second number.

       * The third optional number is the increment used to iterate from the
       first number to the second number.

         foreach(loop_var IN [LISTS [list1 [...]]]
                             [ITEMS [item1 [...]]])

       Iterates over a precise list of items.  The LISTS option names
       list-valued variables to be traversed, including empty elements (an
       empty string is a zero-length list).  The ITEMS option ends argument
       parsing and includes all arguments following it in the iteration.

  function
       Start recording a function for later invocation as a command.

         function(<name> [arg1 [arg2 [arg3 ...]]])
           COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
           COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
           ...
         endfunction(<name>)

       Define a function named <name> that takes arguments named arg1 arg2
       arg3 (...).  Commands listed after function, but before the matching
       endfunction, are not invoked until the function is invoked.  When it
       is invoked, the commands recorded in the function are first modified
       by replacing formal parameters (${arg1}) with the arguments passed,
       and then invoked as normal commands.  In addition to referencing the
       formal parameters you can reference the variable ARGC which will be
       set to the number of arguments passed into the function as well as
       ARGV0 ARGV1 ARGV2 ...  which will have the actual values of the
       arguments passed in.  This facilitates creating functions with
       optional arguments.  Additionally ARGV holds the list of all arguments
       given to the function and ARGN holds the list of arguments past the
       last expected argument.

       A function opens a new scope: see set(var PARENT_SCOPE) for details.

       See the cmake_policy() command documentation for the behavior of
       policies inside functions.

  get_cmake_property
       Get a property of the CMake instance.

         get_cmake_property(VAR property)

       Get a property from the CMake instance.  The value of the property is
       stored in the variable VAR.  If the property is not found, VAR will be
       set to "NOTFOUND".  Some supported properties include: VARIABLES,
       CACHE_VARIABLES, COMMANDS, MACROS, and COMPONENTS.

       See also the more general get_property() command.

  get_directory_property
       Get a property of DIRECTORY scope.

         get_directory_property(<variable> [DIRECTORY <dir>] <prop-name>)

       Store a property of directory scope in the named variable.  If the
       property is not defined the empty-string is returned.  The DIRECTORY
       argument specifies another directory from which to retrieve the
       property value.  The specified directory must have already been
       traversed by CMake.

         get_directory_property(<variable> [DIRECTORY <dir>]
                                DEFINITION <var-name>)

       Get a variable definition from a directory.  This form is useful to
       get a variable definition from another directory.

       See also the more general get_property() command.

  get_filename_component
       Get a specific component of a full filename.

         get_filename_component(<VAR> <FileName> <COMP> [CACHE])

       Set <VAR> to a component of <FileName>, where <COMP> is one of:

        PATH      = Directory without file name
        NAME      = File name without directory
        EXT       = File name longest extension (.b.c from d/a.b.c)
        NAME_WE   = File name without directory or longest extension
        ABSOLUTE  = Full path to file
        REALPATH  = Full path to existing file with symlinks resolved

       Paths are returned with forward slashes and have no trailing slahes.
       The longest file extension is always considered.  If the optional
       CACHE argument is specified, the result variable is added to the
       cache.

         get_filename_component(<VAR> FileName
                                PROGRAM [PROGRAM_ARGS <ARG_VAR>]
                                [CACHE])

       The program in FileName will be found in the system search path or
       left as a full path.  If PROGRAM_ARGS is present with PROGRAM, then
       any command-line arguments present in the FileName string are split
       from the program name and stored in <ARG_VAR>.  This is used to
       separate a program name from its arguments in a command line string.

  get_property
       Get a property.

         get_property(<variable>
                      <GLOBAL             |
                       DIRECTORY [dir]    |
                       TARGET    <target> |
                       SOURCE    <source> |
                       TEST      <test>   |
                       CACHE     <entry>  |
                       VARIABLE>
                      PROPERTY <name>
                      [SET | DEFINED | BRIEF_DOCS | FULL_DOCS])

       Get one property from one object in a scope.  The first argument
       specifies the variable in which to store the result.  The second
       argument determines the scope from which to get the property.  It must
       be one of the following:

       GLOBAL scope is unique and does not accept a name.

       DIRECTORY scope defaults to the current directory but another
       directory (already processed by CMake) may be named by full or
       relative path.

       TARGET scope must name one existing target.

       SOURCE scope must name one source file.

       TEST scope must name one existing test.

       CACHE scope must name one cache entry.

       VARIABLE scope is unique and does not accept a name.

       The required PROPERTY option is immediately followed by the name of
       the property to get.  If the property is not set an empty value is
       returned.  If the SET option is given the variable is set to a boolean
       value indicating whether the property has been set.  If the DEFINED
       option is given the variable is set to a boolean value indicating
       whether the property has been defined such as with define_property.
       If BRIEF_DOCS or FULL_DOCS is given then the variable is set to a
       string containing documentation for the requested property.  If
       documentation is requested for a property that has not been defined
       NOTFOUND is returned.

  if
       Conditionally execute a group of commands.

         if(expression)
           # then section.
           COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
           COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
           ...
         elseif(expression2)
           # elseif section.
           COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
           COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
           ...
         else(expression)
           # else section.
           COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
           COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
           ...
         endif(expression)

       Evaluates the given expression.  If the result is true, the commands
       in the THEN section are invoked.  Otherwise, the commands in the else
       section are invoked.  The elseif and else sections are optional.  You
       may have multiple elseif clauses.  Note that the expression in the
       else and endif clause is optional.  Long expressions can be used and
       there is a traditional order of precedence.  Parenthetical expressions
       are evaluated first followed by unary operators such as EXISTS,
       COMMAND, and DEFINED.  Then any EQUAL, LESS, GREATER, STRLESS,
       STRGREATER, STREQUAL, MATCHES will be evaluated.  Then NOT operators
       and finally AND, OR operators will be evaluated.  Possible expressions
       are:

         if(<constant>)

       True if the constant is 1, ON, YES, TRUE, Y, or a non-zero number.
       False if the constant is 0, OFF, NO, FALSE, N, IGNORE, NOTFOUND, '',
       or ends in the suffix '-NOTFOUND'.  Named boolean constants are
       case-insensitive.  If the argument is not one of these constants, it
       is treated as a variable:

         if(<variable>)

       True if the variable is defined to a value that is not a false
       constant.  False otherwise.  (Note macro arguments are not variables.)

         if(NOT <expression>)

       True if the expression is not true.

         if(<expr1> AND <expr2>)

       True if both expressions would be considered true individually.

         if(<expr1> OR <expr2>)

       True if either expression would be considered true individually.

         if(COMMAND command-name)

       True if the given name is a command, macro or function that can be
       invoked.

         if(POLICY policy-id)

       True if the given name is an existing policy (of the form CMP<NNNN>).

         if(TARGET target-name)

       True if the given name is an existing target, built or imported.

         if(EXISTS file-name)
         if(EXISTS directory-name)

       True if the named file or directory exists.  Behavior is well-defined
       only for full paths.

         if(file1 IS_NEWER_THAN file2)

       True if file1 is newer than file2 or if one of the two files doesn't
       exist.  Behavior is well-defined only for full paths.  If the file
       time stamps are exactly the same, an IS_NEWER_THAN comparison returns
       true, so that any dependent build operations will occur in the event
       of a tie.  This includes the case of passing the same file name for
       both file1 and file2.

         if(IS_DIRECTORY directory-name)

       True if the given name is a directory.  Behavior is well-defined only
       for full paths.

         if(IS_SYMLINK file-name)

       True if the given name is a symbolic link.  Behavior is well-defined
       only for full paths.

         if(IS_ABSOLUTE path)

       True if the given path is an absolute path.

         if(<variable|string> MATCHES regex)

       True if the given string or variable's value matches the given regular
       expression.

         if(<variable|string> LESS <variable|string>)
         if(<variable|string> GREATER <variable|string>)
         if(<variable|string> EQUAL <variable|string>)

       True if the given string or variable's value is a valid number and the
       inequality or equality is true.

         if(<variable|string> STRLESS <variable|string>)
         if(<variable|string> STRGREATER <variable|string>)
         if(<variable|string> STREQUAL <variable|string>)

       True if the given string or variable's value is lexicographically less
       (or greater, or equal) than the string or variable on the right.

         if(<variable|string> VERSION_LESS <variable|string>)
         if(<variable|string> VERSION_EQUAL <variable|string>)
         if(<variable|string> VERSION_GREATER <variable|string>)

       Component-wise integer version number comparison (version format is
       major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]).

         if(DEFINED <variable>)

       True if the given variable is defined.  It does not matter if the
       variable is true or false just if it has been set.

         if((expression) AND (expression OR (expression)))

       The expressions inside the parenthesis are evaluated first and then
       the remaining expression is evaluated as in the previous examples.
       Where there are nested parenthesis the innermost are evaluated as part
       of evaluating the expression that contains them.

       The if command was written very early in CMake's history, predating
       the ${} variable evaluation syntax, and for convenience evaluates
       variables named by its arguments as shown in the above signatures.
       Note that normal variable evaluation with ${} applies before the if
       command even receives the arguments.  Therefore code like

         set(var1 OFF)
         set(var2 "var1")
         if(${var2})

       appears to the if command as

         if(var1)

       and is evaluated according to the if(<variable>) case documented
       above.  The result is OFF which is false.  However, if we remove the
       ${} from the example then the command sees

         if(var2)

       which is true because var2 is defined to "var1" which is not a false
       constant.

       Automatic evaluation applies in the other cases whenever the
       above-documented signature accepts <variable|string>:

       1) The left hand argument to MATCHES is first checked to see if it is
       a defined variable, if so the variable's value is used, otherwise the
       original value is used.

       2) If the left hand argument to MATCHES is missing it returns false
       without error

       3) Both left and right hand arguments to LESS GREATER EQUAL are
       independently tested to see if they are defined variables, if so their
       defined values are used otherwise the original value is used.

       4) Both left and right hand arguments to STRLESS STREQUAL STRGREATER
       are independently tested to see if they are defined variables, if so
       their defined values are used otherwise the original value is used.

       5) Both left and right hand argumemnts to VERSION_LESS VERSION_EQUAL
       VERSION_GREATER are independently tested to see if they are defined
       variables, if so their defined values are used otherwise the original
       value is used.

       6) The right hand argument to NOT is tested to see if it is a boolean
       constant, if so the value is used, otherwise it is assumed to be a
       variable and it is dereferenced.

       7) The left and right hand arguments to AND OR are independently
       tested to see if they are boolean constants, if so they are used as
       such, otherwise they are assumed to be variables and are dereferenced.



  include
       Read CMake listfile code from the given file.

         include(<file|module> [OPTIONAL] [RESULT_VARIABLE <VAR>]
                               [NO_POLICY_SCOPE])

       Reads CMake listfile code from the given file.  Commands in the file
       are processed immediately as if they were written in place of the
       include command.  If OPTIONAL is present, then no error is raised if
       the file does not exist.  If RESULT_VARIABLE is given the variable
       will be set to the full filename which has been included or NOTFOUND
       if it failed.

       If a module is specified instead of a file, the file with name
       <modulename>.cmake is searched first in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH, then in the
       CMake module directory.  There is one exception to this: if the file
       which calls include() is located itself in the CMake module directory,
       then first the CMake module directory is searched and
       CMAKE_MODULE_PATH afterwards.  See also policy CMP0017.

       See the cmake_policy() command documentation for discussion of the
       NO_POLICY_SCOPE option.

  list
       List operations.

         list(LENGTH <list> <output variable>)
         list(GET <list> <element index> [<element index> ...]
              <output variable>)
         list(APPEND <list> <element> [<element> ...])
         list(FIND <list> <value> <output variable>)
         list(INSERT <list> <element_index> <element> [<element> ...])
         list(REMOVE_ITEM <list> <value> [<value> ...])
         list(REMOVE_AT <list> <index> [<index> ...])
         list(REMOVE_DUPLICATES <list>)
         list(REVERSE <list>)
         list(SORT <list>)

       LENGTH will return a given list's length.

       GET will return list of elements specified by indices from the list.

       APPEND will append elements to the list.

       FIND will return the index of the element specified in the list or -1
       if it wasn't found.

       INSERT will insert elements to the list to the specified location.

       REMOVE_AT and REMOVE_ITEM will remove items from the list.  The
       difference is that REMOVE_ITEM will remove the given items, while
       REMOVE_AT will remove the items at the given indices.

       REMOVE_DUPLICATES will remove duplicated items in the list.

       REVERSE reverses the contents of the list in-place.

       SORT sorts the list in-place alphabetically.

       The list subcommands APPEND, INSERT, REMOVE_AT, REMOVE_ITEM,
       REMOVE_DUPLICATES, REVERSE and SORT may create new values for the list
       within the current CMake variable scope.  Similar to the SET command,
       the LIST command creates new variable values in the current scope,
       even if the list itself is actually defined in a parent scope.  To
       propagate the results of these operations upwards, use SET with
       PARENT_SCOPE, SET with CACHE INTERNAL, or some other means of value
       propagation.

       NOTES: A list in cmake is a ; separated group of strings.  To create a
       list the set command can be used.  For example, set(var a b c d e)
       creates a list with a;b;c;d;e, and set(var "a b c d e") creates a
       string or a list with one item in it.

       When specifying index values, if <element index> is 0 or greater, it
       is indexed from the beginning of the list, with 0 representing the
       first list element.  If <element index> is -1 or lesser, it is indexed
       from the end of the list, with -1 representing the last list element.
       Be careful when counting with negative indices: they do not start from
       0.  -0 is equivalent to 0, the first list element.


  macro
       Start recording a macro for later invocation as a command.

         macro(<name> [arg1 [arg2 [arg3 ...]]])
           COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
           COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
           ...
         endmacro(<name>)

       Define a macro named <name> that takes arguments named arg1 arg2 arg3
       (...).  Commands listed after macro, but before the matching endmacro,
       are not invoked until the macro is invoked.  When it is invoked, the
       commands recorded in the macro are first modified by replacing formal
       parameters (${arg1}) with the arguments passed, and then invoked as
       normal commands.  In addition to referencing the formal parameters you
       can reference the values ${ARGC} which will be set to the number of
       arguments passed into the function as well as ${ARGV0} ${ARGV1}
       ${ARGV2} ...  which will have the actual values of the arguments
       passed in.  This facilitates creating macros with optional arguments.
       Additionally ${ARGV} holds the list of all arguments given to the
       macro and ${ARGN} holds the list of arguments past the last expected
       argument.  Note that the parameters to a macro and values such as ARGN
       are not variables in the usual CMake sense.  They are string
       replacements much like the C preprocessor would do with a macro.  If
       you want true CMake variables and/or better CMake scope control you
       should look at the function command.

       See the cmake_policy() command documentation for the behavior of
       policies inside macros.

  mark_as_advanced
       Mark cmake cached variables as advanced.

         mark_as_advanced([CLEAR|FORCE] VAR VAR2 VAR...)

       Mark the named cached variables as advanced.  An advanced variable
       will not be displayed in any of the cmake GUIs unless the show
       advanced option is on.  If CLEAR is the first argument advanced
       variables are changed back to unadvanced.  If FORCE is the first
       argument, then the variable is made advanced.  If neither FORCE nor
       CLEAR is specified, new values will be marked as advanced, but if the
       variable already has an advanced/non-advanced state, it will not be
       changed.

       It does nothing in script mode.

  math
       Mathematical expressions.

         math(EXPR <output variable> <math expression>)

       EXPR evaluates mathematical expression and returns result in the
       output variable.  Example mathematical expression is '5 * ( 10 + 13
       )'.  Supported operators are + - * / % | & ^ ~ << >> * / %.  They have
       the same meaning as they do in C code.

  message
       Display a message to the user.

         message([STATUS|WARNING|AUTHOR_WARNING|FATAL_ERROR|SEND_ERROR]
                 "message to display" ...)

       The optional keyword determines the type of message:

         (none)         = Important information
         STATUS         = Incidental information
         WARNING        = CMake Warning, continue processing
         AUTHOR_WARNING = CMake Warning (dev), continue processing
         SEND_ERROR     = CMake Error, continue processing,
                                       but skip generation
         FATAL_ERROR    = CMake Error, stop processing and generation

       The CMake command-line tool displays STATUS messages on stdout and all
       other message types on stderr.  The CMake GUI displays all messages in
       its log area.  The interactive dialogs (ccmake and CMakeSetup) show
       STATUS messages one at a time on a status line and other messages in
       interactive pop-up boxes.

       CMake Warning and Error message text displays using a simple markup
       language.  Non-indented text is formatted in line-wrapped paragraphs
       delimited by newlines.  Indented text is considered pre-formatted.

  option
       Provides an option that the user can optionally select.

         option(<option_variable> "help string describing option"
                [initial value])

       Provide an option for the user to select as ON or OFF.  If no initial
       value is provided, OFF is used.

       If you have options that depend on the values of other options, see
       the module help for CMakeDependentOption.

  return
       Return from a file, directory or function.

         return()

       Returns from a file, directory or function.  When this command is
       encountered in an included file (via include() or find_package()), it
       causes processing of the current file to stop and control is returned
       to the including file.  If it is encountered in a file which is not
       included by another file, e.g.  a CMakeLists.txt, control is returned
       to the parent directory if there is one.  If return is called in a
       function, control is returned to the caller of the function.  Note
       that a macro is not a function and does not handle return like a
       function does.

  separate_arguments
       Parse space-separated arguments into a semicolon-separated list.

         separate_arguments(<var> <UNIX|WINDOWS>_COMMAND "<args>")

       Parses a unix- or windows-style command-line string "<args>" and
       stores a semicolon-separated list of the arguments in <var>.  The
       entire command line must be given in one "<args>" argument.

       The UNIX_COMMAND mode separates arguments by unquoted whitespace.  It
       recognizes both single-quote and double-quote pairs.  A backslash
       escapes the next literal character (\" is "); there are no special
       escapes (\n is just n).

       The WINDOWS_COMMAND mode parses a windows command-line using the same
       syntax the runtime library uses to construct argv at startup.  It
       separates arguments by whitespace that is not double-quoted.
       Backslashes are literal unless they precede double-quotes.  See the
       MSDN article "Parsing C Command-Line Arguments" for details.

         separate_arguments(VARIABLE)

       Convert the value of VARIABLE to a semi-colon separated list.  All
       spaces are replaced with ';'.  This helps with generating command
       lines.

  set
       Set a CMake, cache or environment variable to a given value.

         set(<variable> <value>
             [[CACHE <type> <docstring> [FORCE]] | PARENT_SCOPE])

       Within CMake sets <variable> to the value <value>.  <value> is
       expanded before <variable> is set to it.  Normally, set will set a
       regular CMake variable.  If CACHE is present, then the <variable> is
       put in the cache instead, unless it is already in the cache.  See
       section 'Variable types in CMake' below for details of regular and
       cache variables and their interactions.  If CACHE is used, <type> and
       <docstring> are required.  <type> is used by the CMake GUI to choose a
       widget with which the user sets a value.  The value for <type> may be
       one of

         FILEPATH = File chooser dialog.
         PATH     = Directory chooser dialog.
         STRING   = Arbitrary string.
         BOOL     = Boolean ON/OFF checkbox.
         INTERNAL = No GUI entry (used for persistent variables).

       If <type> is INTERNAL, the cache variable is marked as internal, and
       will not be shown to the user in tools like cmake-gui.  This is
       intended for values that should be persisted in the cache, but which
       users should not normally change.  INTERNAL implies FORCE.

       Normally, set(...CACHE...) creates cache variables, but does not
       modify them.  If FORCE is specified, the value of the cache variable
       is set, even if the variable is already in the cache.  This should
       normally be avoided, as it will remove any changes to the cache
       variable's value by the user.

       If PARENT_SCOPE is present, the variable will be set in the scope
       above the current scope.  Each new directory or function creates a new
       scope.  This command will set the value of a variable into the parent
       directory or calling function (whichever is applicable to the case at
       hand).  PARENT_SCOPE cannot be combined with CACHE.

       If <value> is not specified then the variable is removed instead of
       set.  See also: the unset() command.

         set(<variable> <value1> ... <valueN>)

       In this case <variable> is set to a semicolon separated list of
       values.

       <variable> can be an environment variable such as:

         set( ENV{PATH} /home/martink )

       in which case the environment variable will be set.

       *** Variable types in CMake ***

       In CMake there are two types of variables: normal variables and cache
       variables.  Normal variables are meant for the internal use of the
       script (just like variables in most programming languages); they are
       not persisted across CMake runs.  Cache variables (unless set with
       INTERNAL) are mostly intended for configuration settings where the
       first CMake run determines a suitable default value, which the user
       can then override, by editing the cache with tools such as ccmake or
       cmake-gui.  Cache variables are stored in the CMake cache file, and
       are persisted across CMake runs.

       Both types can exist at the same time with the same name but different
       values.  When ${FOO} is evaluated, CMake first looks for a normal
       variable 'FOO' in scope and uses it if set.  If and only if no normal
       variable exists then it falls back to the cache variable 'FOO'.

       Some examples:

       The code 'set(FOO "x")' sets the normal variable 'FOO'.  It does not
       touch the cache, but it will hide any existing cache value 'FOO'.

       The code 'set(FOO "x" CACHE ...)' checks for 'FOO' in the cache,
       ignoring any normal variable of the same name.  If 'FOO' is in the
       cache then nothing happens to either the normal variable or the cache
       variable.  If 'FOO' is not in the cache, then it is added to the
       cache.

       Finally, whenever a cache variable is added or modified by a command,
       CMake also *removes* the normal variable of the same name from the
       current scope so that an immediately following evaluation of it will
       expose the newly cached value.

       Normally projects should avoid using normal and cache variables of the
       same name, as this interaction can be hard to follow.  However, in
       some situations it can be useful.  One example (used by some
       projects):

       A project has a subproject in its source tree.  The child project has
       its own CMakeLists.txt, which is included from the parent
       CMakeLists.txt using add_subdirectory().  Now, if the parent and the
       child project provide the same option (for example a compiler option),
       the parent gets the first chance to add a user-editable option to the
       cache.  Normally, the child would then use the same value that the
       parent uses.  However, it may be necessary to hard-code the value for
       the child project's option while still allowing the user to edit the
       value used by the parent project.  The parent project can achieve this
       simply by setting a normal variable with the same name as the option
       in a scope sufficient to hide the option's cache variable from the
       child completely.  The parent has already set the cache variable, so
       the child's set(...CACHE...) will do nothing, and evaluating the
       option variable will use the value from the normal variable, which
       hides the cache variable.

  set_directory_properties
       Set a property of the directory.

         set_directory_properties(PROPERTIES prop1 value1 prop2 value2)

       Set a property for the current directory and subdirectories.  If the
       property is not found, CMake will report an error.  The properties
       include: INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, LINK_DIRECTORIES,
       INCLUDE_REGULAR_EXPRESSION, and ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES.
       ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES is a list of files that will be cleaned as
       a part of "make clean" stage.

  set_property
       Set a named property in a given scope.

         set_property(<GLOBAL                            |
                       DIRECTORY [dir]                   |
                       TARGET    [target1 [target2 ...]] |
                       SOURCE    [src1 [src2 ...]]       |
                       TEST      [test1 [test2 ...]]     |
                       CACHE     [entry1 [entry2 ...]]>
                      [APPEND] [APPEND_STRING]
                      PROPERTY <name> [value1 [value2 ...]])

       Set one property on zero or more objects of a scope.  The first
       argument determines the scope in which the property is set.  It must
       be one of the following:

       GLOBAL scope is unique and does not accept a name.

       DIRECTORY scope defaults to the current directory but another
       directory (already processed by CMake) may be named by full or
       relative path.

       TARGET scope may name zero or more existing targets.

       SOURCE scope may name zero or more source files.  Note that source
       file properties are visible only to targets added in the same
       directory (CMakeLists.txt).

       TEST scope may name zero or more existing tests.

       CACHE scope must name zero or more cache existing entries.

       The required PROPERTY option is immediately followed by the name of
       the property to set.  Remaining arguments are used to compose the
       property value in the form of a semicolon-separated list.  If the
       APPEND option is given the list is appended to any existing property
       value.If the APPEND_STRING option is given the string is append to any
       existing property value as string, i.e.  it results in a longer string
       and not a list of strings.

  site_name
       Set the given variable to the name of the computer.

         site_name(variable)


  string
       String operations.

         string(REGEX MATCH <regular_expression>
                <output variable> <input> [<input>...])
         string(REGEX MATCHALL <regular_expression>
                <output variable> <input> [<input>...])
         string(REGEX REPLACE <regular_expression>
                <replace_expression> <output variable>
                <input> [<input>...])
         string(REPLACE <match_string>
                <replace_string> <output variable>
                <input> [<input>...])
         string(<MD5|SHA1|SHA224|SHA256|SHA384|SHA512>
                <output variable> <input>)
         string(COMPARE EQUAL <string1> <string2> <output variable>)
         string(COMPARE NOTEQUAL <string1> <string2> <output variable>)
         string(COMPARE LESS <string1> <string2> <output variable>)
         string(COMPARE GREATER <string1> <string2> <output variable>)
         string(ASCII <number> [<number> ...] <output variable>)
         string(CONFIGURE <string1> <output variable>
                [@ONLY] [ESCAPE_QUOTES])
         string(TOUPPER <string1> <output variable>)
         string(TOLOWER <string1> <output variable>)
         string(LENGTH <string> <output variable>)
         string(SUBSTRING <string> <begin> <length> <output variable>)
         string(STRIP <string> <output variable>)
         string(RANDOM [LENGTH <length>] [ALPHABET <alphabet>]
                [RANDOM_SEED <seed>] <output variable>)
         string(FIND <string> <substring> <output variable> [REVERSE])
         string(TIMESTAMP <output variable> [<format string>] [UTC])

       REGEX MATCH will match the regular expression once and store the match
       in the output variable.

       REGEX MATCHALL will match the regular expression as many times as
       possible and store the matches in the output variable as a list.

       REGEX REPLACE will match the regular expression as many times as
       possible and substitute the replacement expression for the match in
       the output.  The replace expression may refer to paren-delimited
       subexpressions of the match using \1, \2, ..., \9.  Note that two
       backslashes (\\1) are required in CMake code to get a backslash
       through argument parsing.

       REPLACE will replace all occurrences of match_string in the input with
       replace_string and store the result in the output.

       MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 will compute a
       cryptographic hash of the input string.

       COMPARE EQUAL/NOTEQUAL/LESS/GREATER will compare the strings and store
       true or false in the output variable.

       ASCII will convert all numbers into corresponding ASCII characters.

       CONFIGURE will transform a string like CONFIGURE_FILE transforms a
       file.

       TOUPPER/TOLOWER will convert string to upper/lower characters.

       LENGTH will return a given string's length.

       SUBSTRING will return a substring of a given string.  If length is -1
       the remainder of the string starting at begin will be returned.

       STRIP will return a substring of a given string with leading and
       trailing spaces removed.

       RANDOM will return a random string of given length consisting of
       characters from the given alphabet.  Default length is 5 characters
       and default alphabet is all numbers and upper and lower case letters.
       If an integer RANDOM_SEED is given, its value will be used to seed the
       random number generator.

       FIND will return the position where the given substring was found in
       the supplied string.  If the REVERSE flag was used, the command will
       search for the position of the last occurrence of the specified
       substring.

       The following characters have special meaning in regular expressions:

          ^         Matches at beginning of input
          $         Matches at end of input
          .         Matches any single character
          [ ]       Matches any character(s) inside the brackets
          [^ ]      Matches any character(s) not inside the brackets
           -        Inside brackets, specifies an inclusive range between
                    characters on either side e.g. [a-f] is [abcdef]
                    To match a literal - using brackets, make it the first
                    or the last character e.g. [+*/-] matches basic
                    mathematical operators.
          *         Matches preceding pattern zero or more times
          +         Matches preceding pattern one or more times
          ?         Matches preceding pattern zero or once only
          |         Matches a pattern on either side of the |
          ()        Saves a matched subexpression, which can be referenced 
                    in the REGEX REPLACE operation. Additionally it is saved
                    by all regular expression-related commands, including 
                    e.g. if( MATCHES ), in the variables CMAKE_MATCH_(0..9).

       *, + and ? have higher precedence than concatenation.  | has lower
       precedence than concatenation.  This means that the regular expression
       "^ab+d$" matches "abbd" but not "ababd", and the regular expression
       "^(ab|cd)$" matches "ab" but not "abd".

       TIMESTAMP will write a string representation of the current date
       and/or time to the output variable.

       Should the command be unable to obtain a timestamp the output variable
       will be set to the empty string "".

       The optional UTC flag requests the current date/time representation to
       be in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) rather than local time.

       The optional <format string> may contain the following format
       specifiers:

          %d        The day of the current month (01-31).
          %H        The hour on a 24-hour clock (00-23).
          %I        The hour on a 12-hour clock (01-12).
          %j        The day of the current year (001-366).
          %m        The month of the current year (01-12).
          %M        The minute of the current hour (00-59).
          %S        The second of the current minute.
                    60 represents a leap second. (00-60)
          %U        The week number of the current year (00-53).
          %w        The day of the current week. 0 is Sunday. (0-6)
          %y        The last two digits of the current year (00-99)
          %Y        The current year. 

       Unknown format specifiers will be ignored and copied to the output
       as-is.

       If no explicit <format string> is given it will default to:

          %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S    for local time.
          %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ   for UTC.

  unset
       Unset a variable, cache variable, or environment variable.

         unset(<variable> [CACHE])

       Removes the specified variable causing it to become undefined.  If
       CACHE is present then the variable is removed from the cache instead
       of the current scope.

       <variable> can be an environment variable such as:

         unset(ENV{LD_LIBRARY_PATH})

       in which case the variable will be removed from the current
       environment.

  variable_watch
       Watch the CMake variable for change.

         variable_watch(<variable name> [<command to execute>])

       If the specified variable changes, the message will be printed about
       the variable being changed.  If the command is specified, the command
       will be executed.  The command will receive the following arguments:
       COMMAND(<variable> <access> <value> <current list file> <stack>)

  while
       Evaluate a group of commands while a condition is true

         while(condition)
           COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
           COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
           ...
         endwhile(condition)

       All commands between while and the matching endwhile are recorded
       without being invoked.  Once the endwhile is evaluated, the recorded
       list of commands is invoked as long as the condition is true.  The
       condition is evaluated using the same logic as the if command.

Compatibility Commands

  CMake Compatibility Listfile Commands - Obsolete commands supported by CMake for compatibility.

This is the documentation for now obsolete listfile commands from previous
CMake versions, which are still supported for compatibility reasons.  You
should instead use the newer, faster and shinier new commands.  ;-)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Standard CMake Modules

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Properties of Global Scope

  ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS
       Allow duplicate custom targets to be created.

       Normally CMake requires that all targets built in a project have
       globally unique logical names (see policy CMP0002).  This is necessary
       to generate meaningful project file names in Xcode and VS IDE
       generators.  It also allows the target names to be referenced
       unambiguously.

       Makefile generators are capable of supporting duplicate custom target
       names.  For projects that care only about Makefile generators and do
       not wish to support Xcode or VS IDE generators, one may set this
       property to true to allow duplicate custom targets.  The property
       allows multiple add_custom_target command calls in different
       directories to specify the same target name.  However, setting this
       property will cause non-Makefile generators to produce an error and
       refuse to generate the project.

  DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS
       Specify which configurations are for debugging.

       The value must be a semi-colon separated list of configuration names.
       Currently this property is used only by the target_link_libraries
       command (see its documentation for details).  Additional uses may be
       defined in the future.

       This property must be set at the top level of the project and before
       the first target_link_libraries command invocation.  If any entry in
       the list does not match a valid configuration for the project the
       behavior is undefined.

  DISABLED_FEATURES
       List of features which are disabled during the CMake run.

       List of features which are disabled during the CMake run.  By default
       it contains the names of all packages which were not found.  This is
       determined using the <NAME>_FOUND variables.  Packages which are
       searched QUIET are not listed.  A project can add its own features to
       this list.  This property is used by the macros in
       FeatureSummary.cmake.

  ENABLED_FEATURES
       List of features which are enabled during the CMake run.

       List of features which are enabled during the CMake run.  By default
       it contains the names of all packages which were found.  This is
       determined using the <NAME>_FOUND variables.  Packages which are
       searched QUIET are not listed.  A project can add its own features to
       this list.  This property is used by the macros in
       FeatureSummary.cmake.

  ENABLED_LANGUAGES
       Read-only property that contains the list of currently enabled
       languages

       Set to list of currently enabled languages.

  FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS
       Whether FIND_LIBRARY should automatically search lib64 directories.

       FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS is a boolean specifying whether the
       FIND_LIBRARY command should automatically search the lib64 variant of
       directories called lib in the search path when building 64-bit
       binaries.

  FIND_LIBRARY_USE_OPENBSD_VERSIONING
       Whether FIND_LIBRARY should find OpenBSD-style shared libraries.

       This property is a boolean specifying whether the FIND_LIBRARY command
       should find shared libraries with OpenBSD-style versioned extension:
       ".so.<major>.<minor>".  The property is set to true on OpenBSD and
       false on other platforms.

  GLOBAL_DEPENDS_DEBUG_MODE
       Enable global target dependency graph debug mode.

       CMake automatically analyzes the global inter-target dependency graph
       at the beginning of native build system generation.  This property
       causes it to display details of its analysis to stderr.

  GLOBAL_DEPENDS_NO_CYCLES
       Disallow global target dependency graph cycles.

       CMake automatically analyzes the global inter-target dependency graph
       at the beginning of native build system generation.  It reports an
       error if the dependency graph contains a cycle that does not consist
       of all STATIC library targets.  This property tells CMake to disallow
       all cycles completely, even among static libraries.

  IN_TRY_COMPILE
       Read-only property that is true during a try-compile configuration.

       True when building a project inside a TRY_COMPILE or TRY_RUN command.

  PACKAGES_FOUND
       List of packages which were found during the CMake run.

       List of packages which were found during the CMake run.  Whether a
       package has been found is determined using the <NAME>_FOUND variables.

  PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND
       List of packages which were not found during the CMake run.

       List of packages which were not found during the CMake run.  Whether a
       package has been found is determined using the <NAME>_FOUND variables.

  PREDEFINED_TARGETS_FOLDER
       Name of FOLDER for targets that are added automatically by CMake.

       If not set, CMake uses "CMakePredefinedTargets" as a default value for
       this property.  Targets such as INSTALL, PACKAGE and RUN_TESTS will be
       organized into this FOLDER.  See also the documentation for the FOLDER
       target property.

  REPORT_UNDEFINED_PROPERTIES
       If set, report any undefined properties to this file.

       If this property is set to a filename then when CMake runs it will
       report any properties or variables that were accessed but not defined
       into the filename specified in this property.

  RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE
       Specify a launcher for compile rules.

       Makefile generators prefix compiler commands with the given launcher
       command line.  This is intended to allow launchers to intercept build
       problems with high granularity.  Non-Makefile generators currently
       ignore this property.

  RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM
       Specify a launcher for custom rules.

       Makefile generators prefix custom commands with the given launcher
       command line.  This is intended to allow launchers to intercept build
       problems with high granularity.  Non-Makefile generators currently
       ignore this property.

  RULE_LAUNCH_LINK
       Specify a launcher for link rules.

       Makefile generators prefix link and archive commands with the given
       launcher command line.  This is intended to allow launchers to
       intercept build problems with high granularity.  Non-Makefile
       generators currently ignore this property.

  RULE_MESSAGES
       Specify whether to report a message for each make rule.

       This property specifies whether Makefile generators should add a
       progress message describing what each build rule does.  If the
       property is not set the default is ON.  Set the property to OFF to
       disable granular messages and report only as each target completes.
       This is intended to allow scripted builds to avoid the build time cost
       of detailed reports.  If a CMAKE_RULE_MESSAGES cache entry exists its
       value initializes the value of this property.  Non-Makefile generators
       currently ignore this property.

  TARGET_ARCHIVES_MAY_BE_SHARED_LIBS
       Set if shared libraries may be named like archives.

       On AIX shared libraries may be named "lib<name>.a".  This property is
       set to true on such platforms.

  TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS
       Does the target platform support shared libraries.

       TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS is a boolean specifying whether the target
       platform supports shared libraries.  Basically all current general
       general purpose OS do so, the exception are usually embedded systems
       with no or special OSs.

  USE_FOLDERS
       Use the FOLDER target property to organize targets into folders.

       If not set, CMake treats this property as OFF by default.  CMake
       generators that are capable of organizing into a hierarchy of folders
       use the values of the FOLDER target property to name those folders.
       See also the documentation for the FOLDER target property.

  __CMAKE_DELETE_CACHE_CHANGE_VARS_
       Internal property

       Used to detect compiler changes, Do not set.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Properties on Cache Entries

  ADVANCED
       True if entry should be hidden by default in GUIs.

       This is a boolean value indicating whether the entry is considered
       interesting only for advanced configuration.  The mark_as_advanced()
       command modifies this property.

  HELPSTRING
       Help associated with entry in GUIs.

       This string summarizes the purpose of an entry to help users set it
       through a CMake GUI.

  MODIFIED
       Internal management property.  Do not set or get.

       This is an internal cache entry property managed by CMake to track
       interactive user modification of entries.  Ignore it.

  STRINGS
       Enumerate possible STRING entry values for GUI selection.

       For cache entries with type STRING, this enumerates a set of values.
       CMake GUIs may use this to provide a selection widget instead of a
       generic string entry field.  This is for convenience only.  CMake does
       not enforce that the value matches one of those listed.

  TYPE
       Widget type for entry in GUIs.

       Cache entry values are always strings, but CMake GUIs present widgets
       to help users set values.  The GUIs use this property as a hint to
       determine the widget type.  Valid TYPE values are:

         BOOL          = Boolean ON/OFF value.
         PATH          = Path to a directory.
         FILEPATH      = Path to a file.
         STRING        = Generic string value.
         INTERNAL      = Do not present in GUI at all.
         STATIC        = Value managed by CMake, do not change.
         UNINITIALIZED = Type not yet specified.

       Generally the TYPE of a cache entry should be set by the command which
       creates it (set, option, find_library, etc.).

  VALUE
       Value of a cache entry.

       This property maps to the actual value of a cache entry.  Setting this
       property always sets the value without checking, so use with care.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Properties on Directories

  ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES
       Additional files to clean during the make clean stage.

       A list of files that will be cleaned as a part of the "make clean"
       stage.

  CACHE_VARIABLES
       List of cache variables available in the current directory.

       This read-only property specifies the list of CMake cache variables
       currently defined.  It is intended for debugging purposes.

  CLEAN_NO_CUSTOM
       Should the output of custom commands be left.

       If this is true then the outputs of custom commands for this directory
       will not be removed during the "make clean" stage.

  COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
       Preprocessor definitions for compiling a directory's sources.

       The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to a semicolon-separated
       list of preprocessor definitions using the syntax VAR or VAR=value.
       Function-style definitions are not supported.  CMake will
       automatically escape the value correctly for the native build system
       (note that CMake language syntax may require escapes to specify some
       values).  This property may be set on a per-configuration basis using
       the name COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG> where <CONFIG> is an upper-case
       name (ex.  "COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG").  This property will be
       initialized in each directory by its value in the directory's parent.

       CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported
       by the native build tool.  The VS6 IDE does not support definition
       values with spaces (but NMake does).

       Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping
       certain values.  CMake has work-arounds for many cases but some values
       may just not be possible to pass correctly.  If a value does not seem
       to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work-around the problem by
       adding escape sequences to the value.  Your work-around may break in a
       future version of CMake that has improved escape support.  Instead
       consider defining the macro in a (configured) header file.  Then
       report the limitation.  Known limitations include:

         #          - broken almost everywhere
         ;          - broken in VS IDE and Borland Makefiles
         ,          - broken in VS IDE
         %          - broken in some cases in NMake
         & |        - broken in some cases on MinGW
         ^ < > \"   - broken in most Make tools on Windows

       CMake does not reject these values outright because they do work in
       some cases.  Use with caution.

  COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>
       Per-configuration preprocessor definitions in a directory.

       This is the configuration-specific version of COMPILE_DEFINITIONS.
       This property will be initialized in each directory by its value in
       the directory's parent.


  DEFINITIONS
       For CMake 2.4 compatibility only.  Use COMPILE_DEFINITIONS instead.

       This read-only property specifies the list of flags given so far to
       the add_definitions command.  It is intended for debugging purposes.
       Use the COMPILE_DEFINITIONS instead.

  EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL
       Exclude the directory from the all target of its parent.

       A property on a directory that indicates if its targets are excluded
       from the default build target.  If it is not, then with a Makefile for
       example typing make will cause the targets to be built.  The same
       concept applies to the default build of other generators.

  IMPLICIT_DEPENDS_INCLUDE_TRANSFORM
       Specify #include line transforms for dependencies in a directory.

       This property specifies rules to transform macro-like #include lines
       during implicit dependency scanning of C and C++ source files.  The
       list of rules must be semicolon-separated with each entry of the form
       "A_MACRO(%)=value-with-%" (the % must be literal).  During dependency
       scanning occurrences of A_MACRO(...) on #include lines will be
       replaced by the value given with the macro argument substituted for
       '%'.  For example, the entry

         MYDIR(%)=<mydir/%>

       will convert lines of the form

         #include MYDIR(myheader.h)

       to

         #include <mydir/myheader.h>

       allowing the dependency to be followed.

       This property applies to sources in all targets within a directory.
       The property value is initialized in each directory by its value in
       the directory's parent.

  INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
       List of preprocessor include file search directories.

       This property specifies the list of directories given so far to the
       include_directories command.  This property exists on directories and
       targets.  In addition to accepting values from the include_directories
       command, values may be set directly on any directory or any target
       using the set_property command.  A target gets its initial value for
       this property from the value of the directory property.  A directory
       gets its initial value from its parent directory if it has one.  Both
       directory and target property values are adjusted by calls to the
       include_directories command.

       The target property values are used by the generators to set the
       include paths for the compiler.  See also the include_directories
       command.

  INCLUDE_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
       Include file scanning regular expression.

       This read-only property specifies the regular expression used during
       dependency scanning to match include files that should be followed.
       See the include_regular_expression command.

  INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION
       Enable interprocedural optimization for targets in a directory.

       If set to true, enables interprocedural optimizations if they are
       known to be supported by the compiler.

  INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_<CONFIG>
       Per-configuration interprocedural optimization for a directory.

       This is a per-configuration version of INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION.
       If set, this property overrides the generic property for the named
       configuration.

  LINK_DIRECTORIES
       List of linker search directories.

       This read-only property specifies the list of directories given so far
       to the link_directories command.  It is intended for debugging
       purposes.

  LISTFILE_STACK
       The current stack of listfiles being processed.

       This property is mainly useful when trying to debug errors in your
       CMake scripts.  It returns a list of what list files are currently
       being processed, in order.  So if one listfile does an INCLUDE command
       then that is effectively pushing the included listfile onto the stack.

  MACROS
       List of macro commands available in the current directory.

       This read-only property specifies the list of CMake macros currently
       defined.  It is intended for debugging purposes.  See the macro
       command.

  PARENT_DIRECTORY
       Source directory that added current subdirectory.

       This read-only property specifies the source directory that added the
       current source directory as a subdirectory of the build.  In the
       top-level directory the value is the empty-string.

  RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE
       Specify a launcher for compile rules.

       See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides
       the global property for a directory.

  RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM
       Specify a launcher for custom rules.

       See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides
       the global property for a directory.

  RULE_LAUNCH_LINK
       Specify a launcher for link rules.

       See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides
       the global property for a directory.

  TEST_INCLUDE_FILE
       A cmake file that will be included when ctest is run.

       If you specify TEST_INCLUDE_FILE, that file will be included and
       processed when ctest is run on the directory.

  VARIABLES
       List of variables defined in the current directory.

       This read-only property specifies the list of CMake variables
       currently defined.  It is intended for debugging purposes.

  VS_GLOBAL_SECTION_POST_<section>
       Specify a postSolution global section in Visual Studio.

       Setting a property like this generates an entry of the following form
       in the solution file:

         GlobalSection(<section>) = postSolution
           <contents based on property value>
         EndGlobalSection

       The property must be set to a semicolon-separated list of key=value
       pairs.  Each such pair will be transformed into an entry in the
       solution global section.  Whitespace around key and value is ignored.
       List elements which do not contain an equal sign are skipped.

       This property only works for Visual Studio 7 and above; it is ignored
       on other generators.  The property only applies when set on a
       directory whose CMakeLists.txt conatins a project() command.

       Note that CMake generates postSolution sections ExtensibilityGlobals
       and ExtensibilityAddIns by default.  If you set the corresponding
       property, it will override the default section.  For example, setting
       VS_GLOBAL_SECTION_POST_ExtensibilityGlobals will override the default
       contents of the ExtensibilityGlobals section, while keeping
       ExtensibilityAddIns on its default.

  VS_GLOBAL_SECTION_PRE_<section>
       Specify a preSolution global section in Visual Studio.

       Setting a property like this generates an entry of the following form
       in the solution file:

         GlobalSection(<section>) = preSolution
           <contents based on property value>
         EndGlobalSection

       The property must be set to a semicolon-separated list of key=value
       pairs.  Each such pair will be transformed into an entry in the
       solution global section.  Whitespace around key and value is ignored.
       List elements which do not contain an equal sign are skipped.

       This property only works for Visual Studio 7 and above; it is ignored
       on other generators.  The property only applies when set on a
       directory whose CMakeLists.txt conatins a project() command.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Properties on Source Files

  ABSTRACT
       Is this source file an abstract class.

       A property on a source file that indicates if the source file
       represents a class that is abstract.  This only makes sense for
       languages that have a notion of an abstract class and it is only used
       by some tools that wrap classes into other languages.

  COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
       Preprocessor definitions for compiling a source file.

       The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to a semicolon-separated
       list of preprocessor definitions using the syntax VAR or VAR=value.
       Function-style definitions are not supported.  CMake will
       automatically escape the value correctly for the native build system
       (note that CMake language syntax may require escapes to specify some
       values).  This property may be set on a per-configuration basis using
       the name COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG> where <CONFIG> is an upper-case
       name (ex.  "COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG").

       CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported
       by the native build tool.  The VS6 IDE does not support definition
       values with spaces (but NMake does).  Xcode does not support
       per-configuration definitions on source files.

       Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping
       certain values.  CMake has work-arounds for many cases but some values
       may just not be possible to pass correctly.  If a value does not seem
       to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work-around the problem by
       adding escape sequences to the value.  Your work-around may break in a
       future version of CMake that has improved escape support.  Instead
       consider defining the macro in a (configured) header file.  Then
       report the limitation.  Known limitations include:

         #          - broken almost everywhere
         ;          - broken in VS IDE and Borland Makefiles
         ,          - broken in VS IDE
         %          - broken in some cases in NMake
         & |        - broken in some cases on MinGW
         ^ < > \"   - broken in most Make tools on Windows

       CMake does not reject these values outright because they do work in
       some cases.  Use with caution.

  COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>
       Per-configuration preprocessor definitions on a source file.

       This is the configuration-specific version of COMPILE_DEFINITIONS.
       Note that Xcode does not support per-configuration source file flags
       so this property will be ignored by the Xcode generator.

  COMPILE_FLAGS
       Additional flags to be added when compiling this source file.

       These flags will be added to the list of compile flags when this
       source file builds.  Use COMPILE_DEFINITIONS to pass additional
       preprocessor definitions.

  EXTERNAL_OBJECT
       If set to true then this is an object file.

       If this property is set to true then the source file is really an
       object file and should not be compiled.  It will still be linked into
       the target though.

  Fortran_FORMAT
       Set to FIXED or FREE to indicate the Fortran source layout.

       This property tells CMake whether a given Fortran source file uses
       fixed-format or free-format.  CMake will pass the corresponding format
       flag to the compiler.  Consider using the target-wide Fortran_FORMAT
       property if all source files in a target share the same format.

  GENERATED
       Is this source file generated as part of the build process.

       If a source file is generated by the build process CMake will handle
       it differently in terms of dependency checking etc.  Otherwise having
       a non-existent source file could create problems.

  HEADER_FILE_ONLY
       Is this source file only a header file.

       A property on a source file that indicates if the source file is a
       header file with no associated implementation.  This is set
       automatically based on the file extension and is used by CMake to
       determine if certain dependency information should be computed.

  KEEP_EXTENSION
       Make the output file have the same extension as the source file.

       If this property is set then the file extension of the output file
       will be the same as that of the source file.  Normally the output file
       extension is computed based on the language of the source file, for
       example .cxx will go to a .o extension.

  LABELS
       Specify a list of text labels associated with a source file.

       This property has meaning only when the source file is listed in a
       target whose LABELS property is also set.  No other semantics are
       currently specified.

  LANGUAGE
       What programming language is the file.

       A property that can be set to indicate what programming language the
       source file is.  If it is not set the language is determined based on
       the file extension.  Typical values are CXX C etc.  Setting this
       property for a file means this file will be compiled.  Do not set this
       for header or files that should not be compiled.

  LOCATION
       The full path to a source file.

       A read only property on a SOURCE FILE that contains the full path to
       the source file.

  MACOSX_PACKAGE_LOCATION
       Place a source file inside a Mac OS X bundle, CFBundle, or framework.

       Executable targets with the MACOSX_BUNDLE property set are built as
       Mac OS X application bundles on Apple platforms.  Shared library
       targets with the FRAMEWORK property set are built as Mac OS X
       frameworks on Apple platforms.  Module library targets with the BUNDLE
       property set are built as Mac OS X CFBundle bundles on Apple
       platforms.  Source files listed in the target with this property set
       will be copied to a directory inside the bundle or framework content
       folder specified by the property value.  For bundles the content
       folder is "<name>.app/Contents".  For frameworks the content folder is
       "<name>.framework/Versions/<version>".  For cfbundles the content
       folder is "<name>.bundle/Contents" (unless the extension is changed).
       See the PUBLIC_HEADER, PRIVATE_HEADER, and RESOURCE target properties
       for specifying files meant for Headers, PrivateHeaders, or Resources
       directories.

  OBJECT_DEPENDS
       Additional files on which a compiled object file depends.

       Specifies a semicolon-separated list of full-paths to files on which
       any object files compiled from this source file depend.  An object
       file will be recompiled if any of the named files is newer than it.

       This property need not be used to specify the dependency of a source
       file on a generated header file that it includes.  Although the
       property was originally introduced for this purpose, it is no longer
       necessary.  If the generated header file is created by a custom
       command in the same target as the source file, the automatic
       dependency scanning process will recognize the dependency.  If the
       generated header file is created by another target, an inter-target
       dependency should be created with the add_dependencies command (if one
       does not already exist due to linking relationships).

  OBJECT_OUTPUTS
       Additional outputs for a Makefile rule.

       Additional outputs created by compilation of this source file.  If any
       of these outputs is missing the object will be recompiled.  This is
       supported only on Makefile generators and will be ignored on other
       generators.

  SYMBOLIC
       Is this just a name for a rule.

       If SYMBOLIC (boolean) is set to true the build system will be informed
       that the source file is not actually created on disk but instead used
       as a symbolic name for a build rule.

  WRAP_EXCLUDE
       Exclude this source file from any code wrapping techniques.

       Some packages can wrap source files into alternate languages to
       provide additional functionality.  For example, C++ code can be
       wrapped into Java or Python etc using SWIG etc.  If WRAP_EXCLUDE is
       set to true (1 etc) that indicates then this source file should not be
       wrapped.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Properties on Targets

  <CONFIG>_OUTPUT_NAME
       Old per-configuration target file base name.

       This is a configuration-specific version of OUTPUT_NAME.  Use
       OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG> instead.

  <CONFIG>_POSTFIX
       Postfix to append to the target file name for configuration <CONFIG>.

       When building with configuration <CONFIG> the value of this property
       is appended to the target file name built on disk.  For non-executable
       targets, this property is initialized by the value of the variable
       CMAKE_<CONFIG>_POSTFIX if it is set when a target is created.  This
       property is ignored on the Mac for Frameworks and App Bundles.

  ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
       Output directory in which to build ARCHIVE target files.

       This property specifies the directory into which archive target files
       should be built.  Multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode) append a
       per-configuration subdirectory to the specified directory.  There are
       three kinds of target files that may be built: archive, library, and
       runtime.  Executables are always treated as runtime targets.  Static
       libraries are always treated as archive targets.  Module libraries are
       always treated as library targets.  For non-DLL platforms shared
       libraries are treated as library targets.  For DLL platforms the DLL
       part of a shared library is treated as a runtime target and the
       corresponding import library is treated as an archive target.  All
       Windows-based systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms.  This
       property is initialized by the value of the variable
       CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is created.

  ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>
       Per-configuration output directory for ARCHIVE target files.

       This is a per-configuration version of ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, but
       multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode) do NOT append a
       per-configuration subdirectory to the specified directory.  This
       property is initialized by the value of the variable
       CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG> if it is set when a target is
       created.

  ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME
       Output name for ARCHIVE target files.

       This property specifies the base name for archive target files.  It
       overrides OUTPUT_NAME and OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG> properties.  There are
       three kinds of target files that may be built: archive, library, and
       runtime.  Executables are always treated as runtime targets.  Static
       libraries are always treated as archive targets.  Module libraries are
       always treated as library targets.  For non-DLL platforms shared
       libraries are treated as library targets.  For DLL platforms the DLL
       part of a shared library is treated as a runtime target and the
       corresponding import library is treated as an archive target.  All
       Windows-based systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms.

  ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>
       Per-configuration output name for ARCHIVE target files.

       This is the configuration-specific version of ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME.

  AUTOMOC
       Should the target be processed with automoc (for Qt projects).

       AUTOMOC is a boolean specifying whether CMake will handle the Qt moc
       preprocessor automatically, i.e.  without having to use the
       QT4_WRAP_CPP() or QT5_WRAP_CPP() macro.  Currently Qt4 and Qt5 are
       supported.  When this property is set to TRUE, CMake will scan the
       source files at build time and invoke moc accordingly.  If an #include
       statement like #include "moc_foo.cpp" is found, the Q_OBJECT class
       declaration is expected in the header, and moc is run on the header
       file.  If an #include statement like #include "foo.moc" is found, then
       a Q_OBJECT is expected in the current source file and moc is run on
       the file itself.  Additionally, all header files are parsed for
       Q_OBJECT macros, and if found, moc is also executed on those files.
       The resulting moc files, which are not included as shown above in any
       of the source files are included in a generated
       <targetname>_automoc.cpp file, which is compiled as part of the
       target.This property is initialized by the value of the variable
       CMAKE_AUTOMOC if it is set when a target is created.

       Additional command line options for moc can be set via the
       AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS property.

       By setting the CMAKE_AUTOMOC_RELAXED_MODE variable to TRUE the rules
       for searching the files which will be processed by moc can be relaxed.
       See the documentation for this variable for more details.

  AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS
       Additional options for moc when using automoc (see the AUTOMOC
       property)

       This property is only used if the AUTOMOC property is set to TRUE for
       this target.  In this case, it holds additional command line options
       which will be used when moc is executed during the build, i.e.  it is
       equivalent to the optional OPTIONS argument of the qt4_wrap_cpp()
       macro.

       By default it is empty.

  BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH
       Should build tree targets have install tree rpaths.

       BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to link the
       target in the build tree with the INSTALL_RPATH.  This takes
       precedence over SKIP_BUILD_RPATH and avoids the need for relinking
       before installation.  This property is initialized by the value of the
       variable CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH if it is set when a target is
       created.

  BUNDLE
       This target is a CFBundle on the Mac.

       If a module library target has this property set to true it will be
       built as a CFBundle when built on the mac.  It will have the directory
       structure required for a CFBundle and will be suitable to be used for
       creating Browser Plugins or other application resources.

  BUNDLE_EXTENSION
       The file extension used to name a BUNDLE target on the Mac.

       The default value is "bundle" - you can also use "plugin" or whatever
       file extension is required by the host app for your bundle.

  COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL
       Properties which must be compatible with their link interface

       The COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL property may contain a list of
       propertiesfor this target which must be consistent when evaluated as a
       boolean in the INTERFACE of all linked dependees.  For example, if a
       property "FOO" appears in the list, then for each dependee, the
       "INTERFACE_FOO" property content in all of its dependencies must be
       consistent with each other, and with the "FOO" property in the
       dependee.  Consistency in this sense has the meaning that if the
       property is set, then it must have the same boolean value as all
       others, and if the property is not set, then it is ignored.  Note that
       for each dependee, the set of properties from this property must not
       intersect with the set of properties from the
       COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING property.

  COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING
       Properties which must be string-compatible with their link interface

       The COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING property may contain a list of
       properties for this target which must be the same when evaluated as a
       string in the INTERFACE of all linked dependees.  For example, if a
       property "FOO" appears in the list, then for each dependee, the
       "INTERFACE_FOO" property content in all of its dependencies must be
       equal with each other, and with the "FOO" property in the dependee.
       If the property is not set, then it is ignored.  Note that for each
       dependee, the set of properties from this property must not intersect
       with the set of properties from the COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL
       property.

  COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
       Preprocessor definitions for compiling a target's sources.

       The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to a semicolon-separated
       list of preprocessor definitions using the syntax VAR or VAR=value.
       Function-style definitions are not supported.  CMake will
       automatically escape the value correctly for the native build system
       (note that CMake language syntax may require escapes to specify some
       values).  This property may be set on a per-configuration basis using
       the name COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG> where <CONFIG> is an upper-case
       name (ex.  "COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG").

       CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported
       by the native build tool.  The VS6 IDE does not support definition
       values with spaces (but NMake does).

       Contents of COMPILE_DEFINITIONS may use "generator expressions" with
       the syntax "$<...>".  Generator expressions are evaluted during build
       system generation to produce information specific to each build
       configuration.  Valid expressions are:

         $<0:...>                  = empty string (ignores "...")
         $<1:...>                  = content of "..."
         $<CONFIG:cfg>             = '1' if config is "cfg", else '0'
         $<CONFIGURATION>          = configuration name
         $<BOOL:...>               = '1' if the '...' is true, else '0'
         $<STREQUAL:a,b>           = '1' if a is STREQUAL b, else '0'
         $<ANGLE-R>                = A literal '>'. Used to compare strings which contain a '>' for example.
         $<COMMA>                  = A literal ','. Used to compare strings which contain a ',' for example.
         $<SEMICOLON>              = A literal ';'. Used to prevent list expansion on an argument with ';'.
         $<TARGET_NAME:...>        = Marks ... as being the name of a target.  This is required if exporting targets to multiple dependent export sets.  The '...' must be a literal name of a target- it may not contain generator expressions.
         $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:...>  = content of "..." when the property is exported using install(EXPORT), and empty otherwise.
         $<BUILD_INTERFACE:...>    = content of "..." when the property is exported using export(), or when the target is used by another target in the same buildsystem. Expands to the empty string otherwise.
         $<TARGET_FILE:tgt>        = main file (.exe, .so.1.2, .a)
         $<TARGET_LINKER_FILE:tgt> = file used to link (.a, .lib, .so)
         $<TARGET_SONAME_FILE:tgt> = file with soname (.so.3)

       where "tgt" is the name of a target.  Target file expressions produce
       a full path, but _DIR and _NAME versions can produce the directory and
       file name components:

         $<TARGET_FILE_DIR:tgt>/$<TARGET_FILE_NAME:tgt>
         $<TARGET_LINKER_FILE_DIR:tgt>/$<TARGET_LINKER_FILE_NAME:tgt>
         $<TARGET_SONAME_FILE_DIR:tgt>/$<TARGET_SONAME_FILE_NAME:tgt>

       

         $<TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,prop>   = The value of the property prop on the target tgt.

       Note that tgt is not added as a dependency of the target this
       expression is evaluated on.

         $<TARGET_POLICY:pol>          = '1' if the policy was NEW when the 'head' target was created, else '0'.  If the policy was not set, the warning message for the policy will be emitted.  This generator expression only works for a subset of policies.
         $<INSTALL_PREFIX>         = Content of the install prefix when the target is exported via INSTALL(EXPORT) and empty otherwise.

       Boolean expressions:

         $<AND:?[,?]...>           = '1' if all '?' are '1', else '0'
         $<OR:?[,?]...>            = '0' if all '?' are '0', else '1'
         $<NOT:?>                  = '0' if '?' is '1', else '1'

       where '?' is always either '0' or '1'.

       Expressions with an implicit 'this' target:

         $<TARGET_PROPERTY:prop>   = The value of the property prop on the target on which the generator expression is evaluated.

       Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping
       certain values.  CMake has work-arounds for many cases but some values
       may just not be possible to pass correctly.  If a value does not seem
       to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work-around the problem by
       adding escape sequences to the value.  Your work-around may break in a
       future version of CMake that has improved escape support.  Instead
       consider defining the macro in a (configured) header file.  Then
       report the limitation.  Known limitations include:

         #          - broken almost everywhere
         ;          - broken in VS IDE and Borland Makefiles
         ,          - broken in VS IDE
         %          - broken in some cases in NMake
         & |        - broken in some cases on MinGW
         ^ < > \"   - broken in most Make tools on Windows

       CMake does not reject these values outright because they do work in
       some cases.  Use with caution.

  COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>
       Per-configuration preprocessor definitions on a target.

       This is the configuration-specific version of COMPILE_DEFINITIONS.

  COMPILE_FLAGS
       Additional flags to use when compiling this target's sources.

       The COMPILE_FLAGS property sets additional compiler flags used to
       build sources within the target.  Use COMPILE_DEFINITIONS to pass
       additional preprocessor definitions.

  DEBUG_POSTFIX
       See target property <CONFIG>_POSTFIX.

       This property is a special case of the more-general <CONFIG>_POSTFIX
       property for the DEBUG configuration.

  DEFINE_SYMBOL
       Define a symbol when compiling this target's sources.

       DEFINE_SYMBOL sets the name of the preprocessor symbol defined when
       compiling sources in a shared library.  If not set here then it is set
       to target_EXPORTS by default (with some substitutions if the target is
       not a valid C identifier).  This is useful for headers to know whether
       they are being included from inside their library our outside to
       properly setup dllexport/dllimport decorations.

  ENABLE_EXPORTS
       Specify whether an executable exports symbols for loadable modules.

       Normally an executable does not export any symbols because it is the
       final program.  It is possible for an executable to export symbols to
       be used by loadable modules.  When this property is set to true CMake
       will allow other targets to "link" to the executable with the
       TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES command.  On all platforms a target-level
       dependency on the executable is created for targets that link to it.
       For DLL platforms an import library will be created for the exported
       symbols and then used for linking.  All Windows-based systems
       including Cygwin are DLL platforms.  For non-DLL platforms that
       require all symbols to be resolved at link time, such as Mac OS X, the
       module will "link" to the executable using a flag like
       "-bundle_loader".  For other non-DLL platforms the link rule is simply
       ignored since the dynamic loader will automatically bind symbols when
       the module is loaded.

  EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL
       Exclude the target from the all target.

       A property on a target that indicates if the target is excluded from
       the default build target.  If it is not, then with a Makefile for
       example typing make will cause this target to be built.  The same
       concept applies to the default build of other generators.  Installing
       a target with EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL set to true has undefined behavior.

  EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD
       Exclude target from "Build Solution".

       This property is only used by Visual Studio generators 7 and above.
       When set to TRUE, the target will not be built when you press "Build
       Solution".

  EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD_<CONFIG>
       Per-configuration version of target exclusion from "Build Solution".

       This is the configuration-specific version of
       EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD.  If the generic EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD
       is also set on a target, EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD_<CONFIG> takes
       precedence in configurations for which it has a value.

  EchoString
       A message to be displayed when the target is built.

       A message to display on some generators (such as makefiles) when the
       target is built.

  FOLDER
       Set the folder name.  Use to organize targets in an IDE.

       Targets with no FOLDER property will appear as top level entities in
       IDEs like Visual Studio.  Targets with the same FOLDER property value
       will appear next to each other in a folder of that name.  To nest
       folders, use FOLDER values such as 'GUI/Dialogs' with '/' characters
       separating folder levels.

  FRAMEWORK
       This target is a framework on the Mac.

       If a shared library target has this property set to true it will be
       built as a framework when built on the mac.  It will have the
       directory structure required for a framework and will be suitable to
       be used with the -framework option

  Fortran_FORMAT
       Set to FIXED or FREE to indicate the Fortran source layout.

       This property tells CMake whether the Fortran source files in a target
       use fixed-format or free-format.  CMake will pass the corresponding
       format flag to the compiler.  Use the source-specific Fortran_FORMAT
       property to change the format of a specific source file.  If the
       variable CMAKE_Fortran_FORMAT is set when a target is created its
       value is used to initialize this property.

  Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY
       Specify output directory for Fortran modules provided by the target.

       If the target contains Fortran source files that provide modules and
       the compiler supports a module output directory this specifies the
       directory in which the modules will be placed.  When this property is
       not set the modules will be placed in the build directory
       corresponding to the target's source directory.  If the variable
       CMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY is set when a target is created its
       value is used to initialize this property.

       Note that some compilers will automatically search the module output
       directory for modules USEd during compilation but others will not.  If
       your sources USE modules their location must be specified by
       INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES regardless of this property.

  GENERATOR_FILE_NAME
       Generator's file for this target.

       An internal property used by some generators to record the name of
       project or dsp file associated with this target.  Note that at
       configure time, this property is only set for targets created by
       include_external_msproject().

  GNUtoMS
       Convert GNU import library (.dll.a) to MS format (.lib).

       When linking a shared library or executable that exports symbols using
       GNU tools on Windows (MinGW/MSYS) with Visual Studio installed convert
       the import library (.dll.a) from GNU to MS format (.lib).  Both import
       libraries will be installed by install(TARGETS) and exported by
       install(EXPORT) and export() to be linked by applications with either
       GNU- or MS-compatible tools.

       If the variable CMAKE_GNUtoMS is set when a target is created its
       value is used to initialize this property.  The variable must be set
       prior to the first command that enables a language such as project()
       or enable_language().  CMake provides the variable as an option to the
       user automatically when configuring on Windows with GNU tools.

  HAS_CXX
       Link the target using the C++ linker tool (obsolete).

       This is equivalent to setting the LINKER_LANGUAGE property to CXX.
       See that property's documentation for details.

  IMPLICIT_DEPENDS_INCLUDE_TRANSFORM
       Specify #include line transforms for dependencies in a target.

       This property specifies rules to transform macro-like #include lines
       during implicit dependency scanning of C and C++ source files.  The
       list of rules must be semicolon-separated with each entry of the form
       "A_MACRO(%)=value-with-%" (the % must be literal).  During dependency
       scanning occurrences of A_MACRO(...) on #include lines will be
       replaced by the value given with the macro argument substituted for
       '%'.  For example, the entry

         MYDIR(%)=<mydir/%>

       will convert lines of the form

         #include MYDIR(myheader.h)

       to

         #include <mydir/myheader.h>

       allowing the dependency to be followed.

       This property applies to sources in the target on which it is set.

  IMPORTED
       Read-only indication of whether a target is IMPORTED.

       The boolean value of this property is true for targets created with
       the IMPORTED option to add_executable or add_library.  It is false for
       targets built within the project.

  IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS
       Configurations provided for an IMPORTED target.

       Set this to the list of configuration names available for an IMPORTED
       target.  The names correspond to configurations defined in the project
       from which the target is imported.  If the importing project uses a
       different set of configurations the names may be mapped using the
       MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG> property.  Ignored for non-imported
       targets.

  IMPORTED_IMPLIB
       Full path to the import library for an IMPORTED target.

       Set this to the location of the ".lib" part of a windows DLL.  Ignored
       for non-imported targets.

  IMPORTED_IMPLIB_<CONFIG>
       <CONFIG>-specific version of IMPORTED_IMPLIB property.

       Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
       which the target is imported.

  IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES
       Dependent shared libraries of an imported shared library.

       Shared libraries may be linked to other shared libraries as part of
       their implementation.  On some platforms the linker searches for the
       dependent libraries of shared libraries they are including in the
       link.  Set this property to the list of dependent shared libraries of
       an imported library.  The list should be disjoint from the list of
       interface libraries in the IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES property.
       On platforms requiring dependent shared libraries to be found at link
       time CMake uses this list to add appropriate files or paths to the
       link command line.  Ignored for non-imported targets.

  IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>
       <CONFIG>-specific version of IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES.

       Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
       which the target is imported.  If set, this property completely
       overrides the generic property for the named configuration.

  IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES
       Languages compiled into an IMPORTED static library.

       Set this to the list of languages of source files compiled to produce
       a STATIC IMPORTED library (such as "C" or "CXX").  CMake accounts for
       these languages when computing how to link a target to the imported
       library.  For example, when a C executable links to an imported C++
       static library CMake chooses the C++ linker to satisfy language
       runtime dependencies of the static library.

       This property is ignored for targets that are not STATIC libraries.
       This property is ignored for non-imported targets.

  IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES_<CONFIG>
       <CONFIG>-specific version of IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES.

       Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
       which the target is imported.  If set, this property completely
       overrides the generic property for the named configuration.

  IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
       Transitive link interface of an IMPORTED target.

       Set this to the list of libraries whose interface is included when an
       IMPORTED library target is linked to another target.  The libraries
       will be included on the link line for the target.  Unlike the
       LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES property, this property applies to all
       imported target types, including STATIC libraries.  This property is
       ignored for non-imported targets.

  IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>
       <CONFIG>-specific version of IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES.

       Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
       which the target is imported.  If set, this property completely
       overrides the generic property for the named configuration.

  IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY
       Repetition count for cycles of IMPORTED static libraries.

       This is LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY for IMPORTED targets.

  IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY_<CONFIG>
       <CONFIG>-specific version of IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY.

       If set, this property completely overrides the generic property for
       the named configuration.

  IMPORTED_LOCATION
       Full path to the main file on disk for an IMPORTED target.

       Set this to the location of an IMPORTED target file on disk.  For
       executables this is the location of the executable file.  For bundles
       on OS X this is the location of the executable file inside
       Contents/MacOS under the application bundle folder.  For static
       libraries and modules this is the location of the library or module.
       For shared libraries on non-DLL platforms this is the location of the
       shared library.  For frameworks on OS X this is the location of the
       library file symlink just inside the framework folder.  For DLLs this
       is the location of the ".dll" part of the library.  For UNKNOWN
       libraries this is the location of the file to be linked.  Ignored for
       non-imported targets.

       Projects may skip IMPORTED_LOCATION if the configuration-specific
       property IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG> is set.  To get the location of an
       imported target read one of the LOCATION or LOCATION_<CONFIG>
       properties.

  IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>
       <CONFIG>-specific version of IMPORTED_LOCATION property.

       Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
       which the target is imported.

  IMPORTED_NO_SONAME
       Specifies that an IMPORTED shared library target has no "soname".

       Set this property to true for an imported shared library file that has
       no "soname" field.  CMake may adjust generated link commands for some
       platforms to prevent the linker from using the path to the library in
       place of its missing soname.  Ignored for non-imported targets.

  IMPORTED_NO_SONAME_<CONFIG>
       <CONFIG>-specific version of IMPORTED_NO_SONAME property.

       Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
       which the target is imported.

  IMPORTED_SONAME
       The "soname" of an IMPORTED target of shared library type.

       Set this to the "soname" embedded in an imported shared library.  This
       is meaningful only on platforms supporting the feature.  Ignored for
       non-imported targets.

  IMPORTED_SONAME_<CONFIG>
       <CONFIG>-specific version of IMPORTED_SONAME property.

       Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
       which the target is imported.

  IMPORT_PREFIX
       What comes before the import library name.

       Similar to the target property PREFIX, but used for import libraries
       (typically corresponding to a DLL) instead of regular libraries.  A
       target property that can be set to override the prefix (such as "lib")
       on an import library name.

  IMPORT_SUFFIX
       What comes after the import library name.

       Similar to the target property SUFFIX, but used for import libraries
       (typically corresponding to a DLL) instead of regular libraries.  A
       target property that can be set to override the suffix (such as
       ".lib") on an import library name.

  INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
       List of preprocessor include file search directories.

       This property specifies the list of directories given so far to the
       include_directories command.  This property exists on directories and
       targets.  In addition to accepting values from the include_directories
       command, values may be set directly on any directory or any target
       using the set_property command.  A target gets its initial value for
       this property from the value of the directory property.  A directory
       gets its initial value from its parent directory if it has one.  Both
       directory and target property values are adjusted by calls to the
       include_directories command.

       The target property values are used by the generators to set the
       include paths for the compiler.  See also the include_directories
       command.

       Contents of INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES may use "generator expressions" with
       the syntax "$<...>".  Generator expressions are evaluted during build
       system generation to produce information specific to each build
       configuration.  Valid expressions are:

         $<0:...>                  = empty string (ignores "...")
         $<1:...>                  = content of "..."
         $<CONFIG:cfg>             = '1' if config is "cfg", else '0'
         $<CONFIGURATION>          = configuration name
         $<BOOL:...>               = '1' if the '...' is true, else '0'
         $<STREQUAL:a,b>           = '1' if a is STREQUAL b, else '0'
         $<ANGLE-R>                = A literal '>'. Used to compare strings which contain a '>' for example.
         $<COMMA>                  = A literal ','. Used to compare strings which contain a ',' for example.
         $<SEMICOLON>              = A literal ';'. Used to prevent list expansion on an argument with ';'.
         $<TARGET_NAME:...>        = Marks ... as being the name of a target.  This is required if exporting targets to multiple dependent export sets.  The '...' must be a literal name of a target- it may not contain generator expressions.
         $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:...>  = content of "..." when the property is exported using install(EXPORT), and empty otherwise.
         $<BUILD_INTERFACE:...>    = content of "..." when the property is exported using export(), or when the target is used by another target in the same buildsystem. Expands to the empty string otherwise.
         $<TARGET_FILE:tgt>        = main file (.exe, .so.1.2, .a)
         $<TARGET_LINKER_FILE:tgt> = file used to link (.a, .lib, .so)
         $<TARGET_SONAME_FILE:tgt> = file with soname (.so.3)

       where "tgt" is the name of a target.  Target file expressions produce
       a full path, but _DIR and _NAME versions can produce the directory and
       file name components:

         $<TARGET_FILE_DIR:tgt>/$<TARGET_FILE_NAME:tgt>
         $<TARGET_LINKER_FILE_DIR:tgt>/$<TARGET_LINKER_FILE_NAME:tgt>
         $<TARGET_SONAME_FILE_DIR:tgt>/$<TARGET_SONAME_FILE_NAME:tgt>

       

         $<TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,prop>   = The value of the property prop on the target tgt.

       Note that tgt is not added as a dependency of the target this
       expression is evaluated on.

         $<TARGET_POLICY:pol>          = '1' if the policy was NEW when the 'head' target was created, else '0'.  If the policy was not set, the warning message for the policy will be emitted.  This generator expression only works for a subset of policies.
         $<INSTALL_PREFIX>         = Content of the install prefix when the target is exported via INSTALL(EXPORT) and empty otherwise.

       Boolean expressions:

         $<AND:?[,?]...>           = '1' if all '?' are '1', else '0'
         $<OR:?[,?]...>            = '0' if all '?' are '0', else '1'
         $<NOT:?>                  = '0' if '?' is '1', else '1'

       where '?' is always either '0' or '1'.

       Expressions with an implicit 'this' target:

         $<TARGET_PROPERTY:prop>   = The value of the property prop on the target on which the generator expression is evaluated.


  INSTALL_NAME_DIR
       Mac OSX directory name for installed targets.

       INSTALL_NAME_DIR is a string specifying the directory portion of the
       "install_name" field of shared libraries on Mac OSX to use in the
       installed targets.

  INSTALL_RPATH
       The rpath to use for installed targets.

       A semicolon-separated list specifying the rpath to use in installed
       targets (for platforms that support it).  This property is initialized
       by the value of the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH if it is set when a
       target is created.

  INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH
       Add paths to linker search and installed rpath.

       INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH is a boolean that if set to true will
       append directories in the linker search path and outside the project
       to the INSTALL_RPATH.  This property is initialized by the value of
       the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH if it is set when a
       target is created.

  INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
       List of public compile definitions for a library.

       Targets may populate this property to publish the compile definitions
       required to compile against the headers for the target.  Consuming
       targets can add entries to their own COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property such
       as $<TARGET_PROPERTY:foo,INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS> to use the
       compile definitions specified in the interface of 'foo'.

       Generator expressions are evaluted during build system generation to
       produce information specific to each build configuration.  Valid
       expressions are:

         $<0:...>                  = empty string (ignores "...")
         $<1:...>                  = content of "..."
         $<CONFIG:cfg>             = '1' if config is "cfg", else '0'
         $<CONFIGURATION>          = configuration name
         $<BOOL:...>               = '1' if the '...' is true, else '0'
         $<STREQUAL:a,b>           = '1' if a is STREQUAL b, else '0'
         $<ANGLE-R>                = A literal '>'. Used to compare strings which contain a '>' for example.
         $<COMMA>                  = A literal ','. Used to compare strings which contain a ',' for example.
         $<SEMICOLON>              = A literal ';'. Used to prevent list expansion on an argument with ';'.

         $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:...>  = content of "..." when the property is exported using install(EXPORT), and empty otherwise.
         $<BUILD_INTERFACE:...>    = content of "..." when the property is exported using export(), or when the target is used by another target in the same buildsystem. Expands to the empty string otherwise.
         $<TARGET_FILE:tgt>        = main file (.exe, .so.1.2, .a)
         $<TARGET_LINKER_FILE:tgt> = file used to link (.a, .lib, .so)
         $<TARGET_SONAME_FILE:tgt> = file with soname (.so.3)

       where "tgt" is the name of a target.  Target file expressions produce
       a full path, but _DIR and _NAME versions can produce the directory and
       file name components:

         $<TARGET_FILE_DIR:tgt>/$<TARGET_FILE_NAME:tgt>
         $<TARGET_LINKER_FILE_DIR:tgt>/$<TARGET_LINKER_FILE_NAME:tgt>
         $<TARGET_SONAME_FILE_DIR:tgt>/$<TARGET_SONAME_FILE_NAME:tgt>

       

         $<TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,prop>   = The value of the property prop on the target tgt.

       Note that tgt is not added as a dependency of the target this
       expression is evaluated on.

         $<TARGET_POLICY:pol>          = '1' if the policy was NEW when the 'head' target was created, else '0'.  If the policy was not set, the warning message for the policy will be emitted.  This generator expression only works for a subset of policies.
         $<INSTALL_PREFIX>         = Content of the install prefix when the target is exported via INSTALL(EXPORT) and empty otherwise.

       Boolean expressions:

         $<AND:?[,?]...>           = '1' if all '?' are '1', else '0'
         $<OR:?[,?]...>            = '0' if all '?' are '0', else '1'
         $<NOT:?>                  = '0' if '?' is '1', else '1'

       where '?' is always either '0' or '1'.

       Expressions with an implicit 'this' target:

         $<TARGET_PROPERTY:prop>   = The value of the property prop on the target on which the generator expression is evaluated.


  INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
       List of public include directories for a library.

       Targets may populate this property to publish the include directories
       required to compile against the headers for the target.  Consuming
       targets can add entries to their own INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES property such
       as $<TARGET_PROPERTY:foo,INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES> to use the
       include directories specified in the interface of 'foo'.

       Generator expressions are evaluted during build system generation to
       produce information specific to each build configuration.  Valid
       expressions are:

         $<0:...>                  = empty string (ignores "...")
         $<1:...>                  = content of "..."
         $<CONFIG:cfg>             = '1' if config is "cfg", else '0'
         $<CONFIGURATION>          = configuration name
         $<BOOL:...>               = '1' if the '...' is true, else '0'
         $<STREQUAL:a,b>           = '1' if a is STREQUAL b, else '0'
         $<ANGLE-R>                = A literal '>'. Used to compare strings which contain a '>' for example.
         $<COMMA>                  = A literal ','. Used to compare strings which contain a ',' for example.
         $<SEMICOLON>              = A literal ';'. Used to prevent list expansion on an argument with ';'.
         $<TARGET_NAME:...>        = Marks ... as being the name of a target.  This is required if exporting targets to multiple dependent export sets.  The '...' must be a literal name of a target- it may not contain generator expressions.
         $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:...>  = content of "..." when the property is exported using install(EXPORT), and empty otherwise.
         $<BUILD_INTERFACE:...>    = content of "..." when the property is exported using export(), or when the target is used by another target in the same buildsystem. Expands to the empty string otherwise.
         $<TARGET_FILE:tgt>        = main file (.exe, .so.1.2, .a)
         $<TARGET_LINKER_FILE:tgt> = file used to link (.a, .lib, .so)
         $<TARGET_SONAME_FILE:tgt> = file with soname (.so.3)

       where "tgt" is the name of a target.  Target file expressions produce
       a full path, but _DIR and _NAME versions can produce the directory and
       file name components:

         $<TARGET_FILE_DIR:tgt>/$<TARGET_FILE_NAME:tgt>
         $<TARGET_LINKER_FILE_DIR:tgt>/$<TARGET_LINKER_FILE_NAME:tgt>
         $<TARGET_SONAME_FILE_DIR:tgt>/$<TARGET_SONAME_FILE_NAME:tgt>

       

         $<TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,prop>   = The value of the property prop on the target tgt.

       Note that tgt is not added as a dependency of the target this
       expression is evaluated on.

         $<TARGET_POLICY:pol>          = '1' if the policy was NEW when the 'head' target was created, else '0'.  If the policy was not set, the warning message for the policy will be emitted.  This generator expression only works for a subset of policies.
         $<INSTALL_PREFIX>         = Content of the install prefix when the target is exported via INSTALL(EXPORT) and empty otherwise.

       Boolean expressions:

         $<AND:?[,?]...>           = '1' if all '?' are '1', else '0'
         $<OR:?[,?]...>            = '0' if all '?' are '0', else '1'
         $<NOT:?>                  = '0' if '?' is '1', else '1'

       where '?' is always either '0' or '1'.

       Expressions with an implicit 'this' target:

         $<TARGET_PROPERTY:prop>   = The value of the property prop on the target on which the generator expression is evaluated.


  INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE
       Whether consumers need to create a position-independent target

       The INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE property informs consumers of
       this target whether they must set their POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE
       property to ON.  If this property is set to ON, then the
       POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE property on all consumers will be set to ON.
       Similarly, if this property is set to OFF, then the
       POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE property on all consumers will be set to
       OFF.  If this property is undefined, then consumers will determine
       their POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE property by other means.  Consumers
       must ensure that the targets that they link to have a consistent
       requirement for their INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE property.

  INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION
       Enable interprocedural optimization for a target.

       If set to true, enables interprocedural optimizations if they are
       known to be supported by the compiler.

  INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_<CONFIG>
       Per-configuration interprocedural optimization for a target.

       This is a per-configuration version of INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION.
       If set, this property overrides the generic property for the named
       configuration.

  LABELS
       Specify a list of text labels associated with a target.

       Target label semantics are currently unspecified.

  LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
       Output directory in which to build LIBRARY target files.

       This property specifies the directory into which library target files
       should be built.  Multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode) append a
       per-configuration subdirectory to the specified directory.  There are
       three kinds of target files that may be built: archive, library, and
       runtime.  Executables are always treated as runtime targets.  Static
       libraries are always treated as archive targets.  Module libraries are
       always treated as library targets.  For non-DLL platforms shared
       libraries are treated as library targets.  For DLL platforms the DLL
       part of a shared library is treated as a runtime target and the
       corresponding import library is treated as an archive target.  All
       Windows-based systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms.  This
       property is initialized by the value of the variable
       CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is created.

  LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>
       Per-configuration output directory for LIBRARY target files.

       This is a per-configuration version of LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, but
       multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode) do NOT append a
       per-configuration subdirectory to the specified directory.  This
       property is initialized by the value of the variable
       CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG> if it is set when a target is
       created.

  LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME
       Output name for LIBRARY target files.

       This property specifies the base name for library target files.  It
       overrides OUTPUT_NAME and OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG> properties.  There are
       three kinds of target files that may be built: archive, library, and
       runtime.  Executables are always treated as runtime targets.  Static
       libraries are always treated as archive targets.  Module libraries are
       always treated as library targets.  For non-DLL platforms shared
       libraries are treated as library targets.  For DLL platforms the DLL
       part of a shared library is treated as a runtime target and the
       corresponding import library is treated as an archive target.  All
       Windows-based systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms.

  LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>
       Per-configuration output name for LIBRARY target files.

       This is the configuration-specific version of LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME.

  LINKER_LANGUAGE
       Specifies language whose compiler will invoke the linker.

       For executables, shared libraries, and modules, this sets the language
       whose compiler is used to link the target (such as "C" or "CXX").  A
       typical value for an executable is the language of the source file
       providing the program entry point (main).  If not set, the language
       with the highest linker preference value is the default.  See
       documentation of CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE variables.

  LINK_DEPENDS
       Additional files on which a target binary depends for linking.

       Specifies a semicolon-separated list of full-paths to files on which
       the link rule for this target depends.  The target binary will be
       linked if any of the named files is newer than it.

       This property is ignored by non-Makefile generators.  It is intended
       to specify dependencies on "linker scripts" for custom Makefile link
       rules.

  LINK_DEPENDS_NO_SHARED
       Do not depend on linked shared library files.

       Set this property to true to tell CMake generators not to add
       file-level dependencies on the shared library files linked by this
       target.  Modification to the shared libraries will not be sufficient
       to re-link this target.  Logical target-level dependencies will not be
       affected so the linked shared libraries will still be brought up to
       date before this target is built.

       This property is initialized by the value of the variable
       CMAKE_LINK_DEPENDS_NO_SHARED if it is set when a target is created.

  LINK_FLAGS
       Additional flags to use when linking this target.

       The LINK_FLAGS property can be used to add extra flags to the link
       step of a target.  LINK_FLAGS_<CONFIG> will add to the configuration
       <CONFIG>, for example, DEBUG, RELEASE, MINSIZEREL, RELWITHDEBINFO.

  LINK_FLAGS_<CONFIG>
       Per-configuration linker flags for a target.

       This is the configuration-specific version of LINK_FLAGS.

  LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
       List public interface libraries for a shared library or executable.

       By default linking to a shared library target transitively links to
       targets with which the library itself was linked.  For an executable
       with exports (see the ENABLE_EXPORTS property) no default transitive
       link dependencies are used.  This property replaces the default
       transitive link dependencies with an explicit list.  When the target
       is linked into another target the libraries listed (and recursively
       their link interface libraries) will be provided to the other target
       also.  If the list is empty then no transitive link dependencies will
       be incorporated when this target is linked into another target even if
       the default set is non-empty.  This property is initialized by the
       value of the variable CMAKE_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES if it is set when
       a target is created.  This property is ignored for STATIC libraries.

  LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>
       Per-configuration list of public interface libraries for a target.

       This is the configuration-specific version of
       LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES.  If set, this property completely overrides
       the generic property for the named configuration.

  LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY
       Repetition count for STATIC libraries with cyclic dependencies.

       When linking to a STATIC library target with cyclic dependencies the
       linker may need to scan more than once through the archives in the
       strongly connected component of the dependency graph.  CMake by
       default constructs the link line so that the linker will scan through
       the component at least twice.  This property specifies the minimum
       number of scans if it is larger than the default.  CMake uses the
       largest value specified by any target in a component.

  LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY_<CONFIG>
       Per-configuration repetition count for cycles of STATIC libraries.

       This is the configuration-specific version of
       LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY.  If set, this property completely
       overrides the generic property for the named configuration.

  LINK_LIBRARIES
       List of direct link dependencies.

       This property specifies the list of libraries or targets which will be
       used for linking.  In addition to accepting values from the
       target_link_libraries command, values may be set directly on any
       target using the set_property command.

       The target property values are used by the generators to set the link
       libraries for the compiler.  See also the target_link_libraries
       command.

       Contents of LINK_LIBRARIES may use "generator expressions" with the
       syntax "$<...>".  Generator expressions are evaluted during build
       system generation to produce information specific to each build
       configuration.  Valid expressions are:

         $<0:...>                  = empty string (ignores "...")
         $<1:...>                  = content of "..."
         $<CONFIG:cfg>             = '1' if config is "cfg", else '0'
         $<CONFIGURATION>          = configuration name
         $<BOOL:...>               = '1' if the '...' is true, else '0'
         $<STREQUAL:a,b>           = '1' if a is STREQUAL b, else '0'
         $<ANGLE-R>                = A literal '>'. Used to compare strings which contain a '>' for example.
         $<COMMA>                  = A literal ','. Used to compare strings which contain a ',' for example.
         $<SEMICOLON>              = A literal ';'. Used to prevent list expansion on an argument with ';'.
         $<TARGET_NAME:...>        = Marks ... as being the name of a target.  This is required if exporting targets to multiple dependent export sets.  The '...' must be a literal name of a target- it may not contain generator expressions.
         $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:...>  = content of "..." when the property is exported using install(EXPORT), and empty otherwise.
         $<BUILD_INTERFACE:...>    = content of "..." when the property is exported using export(), or when the target is used by another target in the same buildsystem. Expands to the empty string otherwise.
         $<TARGET_FILE:tgt>        = main file (.exe, .so.1.2, .a)
         $<TARGET_LINKER_FILE:tgt> = file used to link (.a, .lib, .so)
         $<TARGET_SONAME_FILE:tgt> = file with soname (.so.3)

       where "tgt" is the name of a target.  Target file expressions produce
       a full path, but _DIR and _NAME versions can produce the directory and
       file name components:

         $<TARGET_FILE_DIR:tgt>/$<TARGET_FILE_NAME:tgt>
         $<TARGET_LINKER_FILE_DIR:tgt>/$<TARGET_LINKER_FILE_NAME:tgt>
         $<TARGET_SONAME_FILE_DIR:tgt>/$<TARGET_SONAME_FILE_NAME:tgt>

       

         $<TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,prop>   = The value of the property prop on the target tgt.

       Note that tgt is not added as a dependency of the target this
       expression is evaluated on.

         $<TARGET_POLICY:pol>          = '1' if the policy was NEW when the 'head' target was created, else '0'.  If the policy was not set, the warning message for the policy will be emitted.  This generator expression only works for a subset of policies.
         $<INSTALL_PREFIX>         = Content of the install prefix when the target is exported via INSTALL(EXPORT) and empty otherwise.

       Boolean expressions:

         $<AND:?[,?]...>           = '1' if all '?' are '1', else '0'
         $<OR:?[,?]...>            = '0' if all '?' are '0', else '1'
         $<NOT:?>                  = '0' if '?' is '1', else '1'

       where '?' is always either '0' or '1'.

       Expressions with an implicit 'this' target:

         $<TARGET_PROPERTY:prop>   = The value of the property prop on the target on which the generator expression is evaluated.


  LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC
       End a link line such that static system libraries are used.

       Some linkers support switches such as -Bstatic and -Bdynamic to
       determine whether to use static or shared libraries for -lXXX options.
       CMake uses these options to set the link type for libraries whose full
       paths are not known or (in some cases) are in implicit link
       directories for the platform.  By default CMake adds an option at the
       end of the library list (if necessary) to set the linker search type
       back to its starting type.  This property switches the final linker
       search type to -Bstatic regardless of how it started.  See also
       LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC.

  LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC
       Assume the linker looks for static libraries by default.

       Some linkers support switches such as -Bstatic and -Bdynamic to
       determine whether to use static or shared libraries for -lXXX options.
       CMake uses these options to set the link type for libraries whose full
       paths are not known or (in some cases) are in implicit link
       directories for the platform.  By default the linker search type is
       assumed to be -Bdynamic at the beginning of the library list.  This
       property switches the assumption to -Bstatic.  It is intended for use
       when linking an executable statically (e.g.  with the GNU -static
       option).  See also LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC.

  LOCATION
       Read-only location of a target on disk.

       For an imported target, this read-only property returns the value of
       the LOCATION_<CONFIG> property for an unspecified configuration
       <CONFIG> provided by the target.

       For a non-imported target, this property is provided for compatibility
       with CMake 2.4 and below.  It was meant to get the location of an
       executable target's output file for use in add_custom_command.  The
       path may contain a build-system-specific portion that is replaced at
       build time with the configuration getting built (such as
       "$(ConfigurationName)" in VS).  In CMake 2.6 and above
       add_custom_command automatically recognizes a target name in its
       COMMAND and DEPENDS options and computes the target location.  In
       CMake 2.8.4 and above add_custom_command recognizes generator
       expressions to refer to target locations anywhere in the command.
       Therefore this property is not needed for creating custom commands.

       Do not set properties that affect the location of a target after
       reading this property.  These include properties whose names match
       "(RUNTIME|LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_<CONFIG>)?",
       "(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|SUFFIX)", or "LINKER_LANGUAGE".  Failure to follow
       this rule is not diagnosed and leaves the location of the target
       undefined.

  LOCATION_<CONFIG>
       Read-only property providing a target location on disk.

       A read-only property that indicates where a target's main file is
       located on disk for the configuration <CONFIG>.  The property is
       defined only for library and executable targets.  An imported target
       may provide a set of configurations different from that of the
       importing project.  By default CMake looks for an exact-match but
       otherwise uses an arbitrary available configuration.  Use the
       MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG> property to map imported configurations
       explicitly.

       Do not set properties that affect the location of a target after
       reading this property.  These include properties whose names match
       "(RUNTIME|LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_<CONFIG>)?",
       "(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|SUFFIX)", or "LINKER_LANGUAGE".  Failure to follow
       this rule is not diagnosed and leaves the location of the target
       undefined.

  MACOSX_BUNDLE
       Build an executable as an application bundle on Mac OS X.

       When this property is set to true the executable when built on Mac OS
       X will be created as an application bundle.  This makes it a GUI
       executable that can be launched from the Finder.  See the
       MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST target property for information about
       creation of the Info.plist file for the application bundle.  This
       property is initialized by the value of the variable
       CMAKE_MACOSX_BUNDLE if it is set when a target is created.

  MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST
       Specify a custom Info.plist template for a Mac OS X App Bundle.

       An executable target with MACOSX_BUNDLE enabled will be built as an
       application bundle on Mac OS X.  By default its Info.plist file is
       created by configuring a template called MacOSXBundleInfo.plist.in
       located in the CMAKE_MODULE_PATH.  This property specifies an
       alternative template file name which may be a full path.

       The following target properties may be set to specify content to be
       configured into the file:

         MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_STRING
         MACOSX_BUNDLE_ICON_FILE
         MACOSX_BUNDLE_GUI_IDENTIFIER
         MACOSX_BUNDLE_LONG_VERSION_STRING
         MACOSX_BUNDLE_BUNDLE_NAME
         MACOSX_BUNDLE_SHORT_VERSION_STRING
         MACOSX_BUNDLE_BUNDLE_VERSION
         MACOSX_BUNDLE_COPYRIGHT

       CMake variables of the same name may be set to affect all targets in a
       directory that do not have each specific property set.  If a custom
       Info.plist is specified by this property it may of course hard-code
       all the settings instead of using the target properties.

  MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_INFO_PLIST
       Specify a custom Info.plist template for a Mac OS X Framework.

       An library target with FRAMEWORK enabled will be built as a framework
       on Mac OS X.  By default its Info.plist file is created by configuring
       a template called MacOSXFrameworkInfo.plist.in located in the
       CMAKE_MODULE_PATH.  This property specifies an alternative template
       file name which may be a full path.

       The following target properties may be set to specify content to be
       configured into the file:

         MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_ICON_FILE
         MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_IDENTIFIER
         MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_SHORT_VERSION_STRING
         MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_BUNDLE_VERSION

       CMake variables of the same name may be set to affect all targets in a
       directory that do not have each specific property set.  If a custom
       Info.plist is specified by this property it may of course hard-code
       all the settings instead of using the target properties.

  MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>
       Map from project configuration to IMPORTED target's configuration.

       Set this to the list of configurations of an imported target that may
       be used for the current project's <CONFIG> configuration.  Targets
       imported from another project may not provide the same set of
       configuration names available in the current project.  Setting this
       property tells CMake what imported configurations are suitable for use
       when building the <CONFIG> configuration.  The first configuration in
       the list found to be provided by the imported target is selected.  If
       this property is set and no matching configurations are available,
       then the imported target is considered to be not found.  This property
       is ignored for non-imported targets.

  NO_SONAME
       Whether to set "soname" when linking a shared library or module.

       Enable this boolean property if a generated shared library or module
       should not have "soname" set.  Default is to set "soname" on all
       shared libraries and modules as long as the platform supports it.
       Generally, use this property only for leaf private libraries or
       plugins.  If you use it on normal shared libraries which other targets
       link against, on some platforms a linker will insert a full path to
       the library (as specified at link time) into the dynamic section of
       the dependent binary.  Therefore, once installed, dynamic loader may
       eventually fail to locate the library for the binary.

  OSX_ARCHITECTURES
       Target specific architectures for OS X.

       The OSX_ARCHITECTURES property sets the target binary architecture for
       targets on OS X.  This property is initialized by the value of the
       variable CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES if it is set when a target is
       created.  Use OSX_ARCHITECTURES_<CONFIG> to set the binary
       architectures on a per-configuration basis.  <CONFIG> is an upper-case
       name (ex: "OSX_ARCHITECTURES_DEBUG").

  OSX_ARCHITECTURES_<CONFIG>
       Per-configuration OS X binary architectures for a target.

       This property is the configuration-specific version of
       OSX_ARCHITECTURES.

  OUTPUT_NAME
       Output name for target files.

       This sets the base name for output files created for an executable or
       library target.  If not set, the logical target name is used by
       default.

  OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>
       Per-configuration target file base name.

       This is the configuration-specific version of OUTPUT_NAME.

  PDB_NAME
       Output name for MS debug symbols .pdb file.

       Set the base name for debug symbols file created for an executable or
       library target.  If not set, the logical target name is used by
       default.

       This property is not implemented by the Visual Studio 6 generator.

  PDB_NAME_<CONFIG>
       Per-configuration name for MS debug symbols .pdb file.

       This is the configuration-specific version of PDB_NAME.

       This property is not implemented by the Visual Studio 6 generator.

  PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
       Output directory for MS debug symbols .pdb files.

       This property specifies the directory into which the MS debug symbols
       will be placed.  This property is initialized by the value of the
       variable CMAKE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is
       created.

       This property is not implemented by the Visual Studio 6 generator.

  PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>
       Per-configuration output directory for MS debug symbols .pdb files.

       This is a per-configuration version of PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, but
       multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode) do NOT append a
       per-configuration subdirectory to the specified directory.  This
       property is initialized by the value of the variable
       CMAKE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG> if it is set when a target is
       created.

       This property is not implemented by the Visual Studio 6 generator.

  POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE
       Whether to create a position-independent target

       The POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE property determines whether position
       independent executables or shared libraries will be created.  This
       property is true by default for SHARED and MODULE library targets and
       false otherwise.  This property is initialized by the value of the
       variable CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE if it is set when a target is
       created.

  POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT
       Deprecated install support.

       The PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT properties are the old
       way to specify CMake scripts to run before and after installing a
       target.  They are used only when the old INSTALL_TARGETS command is
       used to install the target.  Use the INSTALL command instead.

  PREFIX
       What comes before the library name.

       A target property that can be set to override the prefix (such as
       "lib") on a library name.

  PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT
       Deprecated install support.

       The PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT properties are the old
       way to specify CMake scripts to run before and after installing a
       target.  They are used only when the old INSTALL_TARGETS command is
       used to install the target.  Use the INSTALL command instead.

  PRIVATE_HEADER
       Specify private header files in a FRAMEWORK shared library target.

       Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK property generate
       frameworks on OS X and normal shared libraries on other platforms.
       This property may be set to a list of header files to be placed in the
       PrivateHeaders directory inside the framework folder.  On non-Apple
       platforms these headers may be installed using the PRIVATE_HEADER
       option to the install(TARGETS) command.

  PROJECT_LABEL
       Change the name of a target in an IDE.

       Can be used to change the name of the target in an IDE like Visual
       Studio.

  PUBLIC_HEADER
       Specify public header files in a FRAMEWORK shared library target.

       Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK property generate
       frameworks on OS X and normal shared libraries on other platforms.
       This property may be set to a list of header files to be placed in the
       Headers directory inside the framework folder.  On non-Apple platforms
       these headers may be installed using the PUBLIC_HEADER option to the
       install(TARGETS) command.

  RESOURCE
       Specify resource files in a FRAMEWORK shared library target.

       Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK property generate
       frameworks on OS X and normal shared libraries on other platforms.
       This property may be set to a list of files to be placed in the
       Resources directory inside the framework folder.  On non-Apple
       platforms these files may be installed using the RESOURCE option to
       the install(TARGETS) command.

  RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE
       Specify a launcher for compile rules.

       See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides
       the global and directory property for a target.

  RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM
       Specify a launcher for custom rules.

       See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides
       the global and directory property for a target.

  RULE_LAUNCH_LINK
       Specify a launcher for link rules.

       See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides
       the global and directory property for a target.

  RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
       Output directory in which to build RUNTIME target files.

       This property specifies the directory into which runtime target files
       should be built.  Multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode) append a
       per-configuration subdirectory to the specified directory.  There are
       three kinds of target files that may be built: archive, library, and
       runtime.  Executables are always treated as runtime targets.  Static
       libraries are always treated as archive targets.  Module libraries are
       always treated as library targets.  For non-DLL platforms shared
       libraries are treated as library targets.  For DLL platforms the DLL
       part of a shared library is treated as a runtime target and the
       corresponding import library is treated as an archive target.  All
       Windows-based systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms.  This
       property is initialized by the value of the variable
       CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is created.

  RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>
       Per-configuration output directory for RUNTIME target files.

       This is a per-configuration version of RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, but
       multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode) do NOT append a
       per-configuration subdirectory to the specified directory.  This
       property is initialized by the value of the variable
       CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG> if it is set when a target is
       created.

  RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME
       Output name for RUNTIME target files.

       This property specifies the base name for runtime target files.  It
       overrides OUTPUT_NAME and OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG> properties.  There are
       three kinds of target files that may be built: archive, library, and
       runtime.  Executables are always treated as runtime targets.  Static
       libraries are always treated as archive targets.  Module libraries are
       always treated as library targets.  For non-DLL platforms shared
       libraries are treated as library targets.  For DLL platforms the DLL
       part of a shared library is treated as a runtime target and the
       corresponding import library is treated as an archive target.  All
       Windows-based systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms.

  RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>
       Per-configuration output name for RUNTIME target files.

       This is the configuration-specific version of RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME.

  SKIP_BUILD_RPATH
       Should rpaths be used for the build tree.

       SKIP_BUILD_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to skip automatic
       generation of an rpath allowing the target to run from the build tree.
       This property is initialized by the value of the variable
       CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH if it is set when a target is created.

  SOURCES
       Source names specified for a target.

       Read-only list of sources specified for a target.  The names returned
       are suitable for passing to the set_source_files_properties command.

  SOVERSION
       What version number is this target.

       For shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used to specify the
       build version and api version respectively.  When building or
       installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports
       symlinks and the linker supports so-names.  If only one of both is
       specified the missing is assumed to have the same version number.
       SOVERSION is ignored if NO_SONAME property is set.  For shared
       libraries and executables on Windows the VERSION attribute is parsed
       to extract a "major.minor" version number.  These numbers are used as
       the image version of the binary.

  STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS
       Extra flags to use when linking static libraries.

       Extra flags to use when linking a static library.

  STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS_<CONFIG>
       Per-configuration flags for creating a static library.

       This is the configuration-specific version of STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS.

  SUFFIX
       What comes after the target name.

       A target property that can be set to override the suffix (such as
       ".so" or ".exe") on the name of a library, module or executable.

  TYPE
       The type of the target.

       This read-only property can be used to test the type of the given
       target.  It will be one of STATIC_LIBRARY, MODULE_LIBRARY,
       SHARED_LIBRARY, EXECUTABLE or one of the internal target types.

  VERSION
       What version number is this target.

       For shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used to specify the
       build version and api version respectively.  When building or
       installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports
       symlinks and the linker supports so-names.  If only one of both is
       specified the missing is assumed to have the same version number.  For
       executables VERSION can be used to specify the build version.  When
       building or installing appropriate symlinks are created if the
       platform supports symlinks.  For shared libraries and executables on
       Windows the VERSION attribute is parsed to extract a "major.minor"
       version number.  These numbers are used as the image version of the
       binary.

  VS_DOTNET_REFERENCES
       Visual Studio managed project .NET references

       Adds one or more semicolon-delimited .NET references to a generated
       Visual Studio project.  For example, "System;System.Windows.Forms".

  VS_GLOBAL_<variable>
       Visual Studio project-specific global variable.

       Tell the Visual Studio generator to set the global variable
       '<variable>' to a given value in the generated Visual Studio project.
       Ignored on other generators.  Qt integration works better if
       VS_GLOBAL_QtVersion is set to the version FindQt4.cmake found.  For
       example, "4.7.3"

  VS_GLOBAL_KEYWORD
       Visual Studio project keyword.

       Sets the "keyword" attribute for a generated Visual Studio project.
       Defaults to "Win32Proj".  You may wish to override this value with
       "ManagedCProj", for example, in a Visual Studio managed C++ unit test
       project.

  VS_GLOBAL_PROJECT_TYPES
       Visual Studio project type(s).

       Can be set to one or more UUIDs recognized by Visual Studio to
       indicate the type of project.  This value is copied verbatim into the
       generated project file.  Example for a managed C++ unit testing
       project:

        {3AC096D0-A1C2-E12C-1390-A8335801FDAB};{8BC9CEB8-8B4A-11D0-8D11-00A0C91BC942}

       UUIDs are semicolon-delimited.

  VS_KEYWORD
       Visual Studio project keyword.

       Can be set to change the visual studio keyword, for example Qt
       integration works better if this is set to Qt4VSv1.0.

  VS_SCC_AUXPATH
       Visual Studio Source Code Control Aux Path.

       Can be set to change the visual studio source code control auxpath
       property.

  VS_SCC_LOCALPATH
       Visual Studio Source Code Control Local Path.

       Can be set to change the visual studio source code control local path
       property.

  VS_SCC_PROJECTNAME
       Visual Studio Source Code Control Project.

       Can be set to change the visual studio source code control project
       name property.

  VS_SCC_PROVIDER
       Visual Studio Source Code Control Provider.

       Can be set to change the visual studio source code control provider
       property.

  VS_WINRT_EXTENSIONS
       Visual Studio project C++/CX language extensions for Windows Runtime

       Can be set to enable C++/CX language extensions.

  VS_WINRT_REFERENCES
       Visual Studio project Windows Runtime Metadata references

       Adds one or more semicolon-delimited WinRT references to a generated
       Visual Studio project.  For example, "Windows;Windows.UI.Core".

  WIN32_EXECUTABLE
       Build an executable with a WinMain entry point on windows.

       When this property is set to true the executable when linked on
       Windows will be created with a WinMain() entry point instead of just
       main().  This makes it a GUI executable instead of a console
       application.  See the CMAKE_MFC_FLAG variable documentation to
       configure use of MFC for WinMain executables.  This property is
       initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_WIN32_EXECUTABLE if it
       is set when a target is created.

  XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_<an-attribute>
       Set Xcode target attributes directly.

       Tell the Xcode generator to set '<an-attribute>' to a given value in
       the generated Xcode project.  Ignored on other generators.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Properties on Tests

  ATTACHED_FILES
       Attach a list of files to a dashboard submission.

       Set this property to a list of files that will be encoded and
       submitted to the dashboard as an addition to the test result.

  ATTACHED_FILES_ON_FAIL
       Attach a list of files to a dashboard submission if the test fails.

       Same as ATTACHED_FILES, but these files will only be included if the
       test does not pass.

  COST
       Set this to a floating point value.  Tests in a test set will be run
       in descending order of cost.

       This property describes the cost of a test.  You can explicitly set
       this value; tests with higher COST values will run first.

  DEPENDS
       Specifies that this test should only be run after the specified list
       of tests.

       Set this to a list of tests that must finish before this test is run.

  ENVIRONMENT
       Specify environment variables that should be defined for running a
       test.

       If set to a list of environment variables and values of the form
       MYVAR=value those environment variables will be defined while running
       the test.  The environment is restored to its previous state after the
       test is done.

  FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
       If the output matches this regular expression the test will fail.

       If set, if the output matches one of specified regular expressions,
       the test will fail.For example: PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
       "[^a-z]Error;ERROR;Failed"

  LABELS
       Specify a list of text labels associated with a test.

       The list is reported in dashboard submissions.

  MEASUREMENT
       Specify a CDASH measurement and value to be reported for a test.

       If set to a name then that name will be reported to CDASH as a named
       measurement with a value of 1.  You may also specify a value by
       setting MEASUREMENT to "measurement=value".

  PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
       The output must match this regular expression for the test to pass.

       If set, the test output will be checked against the specified regular
       expressions and at least one of the regular expressions has to match,
       otherwise the test will fail.

  PROCESSORS
       How many process slots this test requires

       Denotes the number of processors that this test will require.  This is
       typically used for MPI tests, and should be used in conjunction with
       the ctest_test PARALLEL_LEVEL option.

  REQUIRED_FILES
       List of files required to run the test.

       If set to a list of files, the test will not be run unless all of the
       files exist.

  RESOURCE_LOCK
       Specify a list of resources that are locked by this test.

       If multiple tests specify the same resource lock, they are guaranteed
       not to run concurrently.

  RUN_SERIAL
       Do not run this test in parallel with any other test.

       Use this option in conjunction with the ctest_test PARALLEL_LEVEL
       option to specify that this test should not be run in parallel with
       any other tests.

  TIMEOUT
       How many seconds to allow for this test.

       This property if set will limit a test to not take more than the
       specified number of seconds to run.  If it exceeds that the test
       process will be killed and ctest will move to the next test.  This
       setting takes precedence over CTEST_TESTING_TIMEOUT.

  WILL_FAIL
       If set to true, this will invert the pass/fail flag of the test.

       This property can be used for tests that are expected to fail and
       return a non zero return code.

  WORKING_DIRECTORY
       The directory from which the test executable will be called.

       If this is not set it is called from the directory the test executable
       is located in.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Variables

  CPACK_ERROR_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION
       Ask CPack to error out as soon as a file with absolute INSTALL
       DESTINATION is encountered.

       The fatal error is emitted before the installation of the offending
       file takes place.  Some CPack generators, like NSIS,enforce this
       internally.  This variable triggers the definition
       ofCMAKE_ERROR_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION when CPack runsVariables
       common to all CPack generators

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Variables That Change Behavior

  BUILD_SHARED_LIBS
       Global flag to cause add_library to create shared libraries if on.

       If present and true, this will cause all libraries to be built shared
       unless the library was explicitly added as a static library.  This
       variable is often added to projects as an OPTION so that each user of
       a project can decide if they want to build the project using shared or
       static libraries.

  CMAKE_ABSOLUTE_DESTINATION_FILES
       List of files which have been installed using an ABSOLUTE DESTINATION
       path.

       This variable is defined by CMake-generated cmake_install.cmake
       scripts.  It can be used (read-only) by program or script that source
       those install scripts.  This is used by some CPack generators (e.g.
       RPM).

  CMAKE_AUTOMOC_RELAXED_MODE
       Switch between strict and relaxed automoc mode.

       By default, automoc behaves exactly as described in the documentation
       of the AUTOMOC target property.  When set to TRUE, it accepts more
       input and tries to find the correct input file for moc even if it
       differs from the documented behaviour.  In this mode it e.g.  also
       checks whether a header file is intended to be processed by moc when a
       "foo.moc" file has been included.

       Relaxed mode has to be enabled for KDE4 compatibility.

  CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY
       Version of cmake required to build project

       From the point of view of backwards compatibility, this specifies what
       version of CMake should be supported.  By default this value is the
       version number of CMake that you are running.  You can set this to an
       older version of CMake to support deprecated commands of CMake in
       projects that were written to use older versions of CMake.  This can
       be set by the user or set at the beginning of a CMakeLists file.

  CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
       Specifies the build type for make based generators.

       This specifies what build type will be built in this tree.  Possible
       values are empty, Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo and MinSizeRel.  This
       variable is only supported for make based generators.  If this
       variable is supported, then CMake will also provide initial values for
       the variables with the name
       CMAKE_C_FLAGS_[DEBUG|RELEASE|RELWITHDEBINFO|MINSIZEREL].  For example,
       if CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is Debug, then CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG will be added
       to the CMAKE_C_FLAGS.

  CMAKE_COLOR_MAKEFILE
       Enables color output when using the Makefile generator.

       When enabled, the generated Makefiles will produce colored output.
       Default is ON.

  CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES
       Specifies the available build types.

       This specifies what build types will be available such as Debug,
       Release, RelWithDebInfo etc.  This has reasonable defaults on most
       platforms.  But can be extended to provide other build types.  See
       also CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.

  CMAKE_DEBUG_TARGET_PROPERTIES
       Enables tracing output for target properties.

       This variable can be populated with a list of properties to generate
       debug output for when evaluating target properties.  Currently it can
       only be used when evaluating the INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES target property.
       In that case, it outputs a backtrace for each include directory in the
       build.  Default is unset.

  CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_<PackageName>
       Variable for disabling find_package() calls.

       Every non-REQUIRED find_package() call in a project can be disabled by
       setting the variable CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_<PackageName> to TRUE.
       This can be used to build a project without an optional package,
       although that package is installed.

       This switch should be used during the initial CMake run.  Otherwise if
       the package has already been found in a previous CMake run, the
       variables which have been stored in the cache will still be there.  In
       the case it is recommended to remove the cache variables for this
       package from the cache using the cache editor or cmake -U

  CMAKE_ERROR_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION
       Ask cmake_install.cmake script to error out as soon as a file with
       absolute INSTALL DESTINATION is encountered.

       The fatal error is emitted before the installation of the offending
       file takes place.  This variable is used by CMake-generated
       cmake_install.cmake scripts.  If ones set this variable to ON while
       running the script, it may get fatal error messages from the script.

  CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_PREFIXES
       Prefixes to prepend when looking for libraries.

       This specifies what prefixes to add to library names when the
       find_library command looks for libraries.  On UNIX systems this is
       typically lib, meaning that when trying to find the foo library it
       will look for libfoo.

  CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES
       Suffixes to append when looking for libraries.

       This specifies what suffixes to add to library names when the
       find_library command looks for libraries.  On Windows systems this is
       typically .lib and .dll, meaning that when trying to find the foo
       library it will look for foo.dll etc.

  CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_WARN_NO_MODULE
       Tell find_package to warn if called without an explicit mode.

       If find_package is called without an explicit mode option (MODULE,
       CONFIG or NO_MODULE) and no Find<pkg>.cmake module is in
       CMAKE_MODULE_PATH then CMake implicitly assumes that the caller
       intends to search for a package configuration file.  If no package
       configuration file is found then the wording of the failure message
       must account for both the case that the package is really missing and
       the case that the project has a bug and failed to provide the intended
       Find module.  If instead the caller specifies an explicit mode option
       then the failure message can be more specific.

       Set CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_WARN_NO_MODULE to TRUE to tell find_package to
       warn when it implicitly assumes Config mode.  This helps developers
       enforce use of an explicit mode in all calls to find_package within a
       project.

  CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH
       Path to be ignored by FIND_XXX() commands.

       Specifies directories to be ignored by searches in FIND_XXX()
       commands.  This is useful in cross-compiled environments where some
       system directories contain incompatible but possibly linkable
       libraries.  For example, on cross-compiled cluster environments, this
       allows a user to ignore directories containing libraries meant for the
       front-end machine that modules like FindX11 (and others) would
       normally search.  By default this is empty; it is intended to be set
       by the project.  Note that CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH takes a list of directory
       names, NOT a list of prefixes.  If you want to ignore paths under
       prefixes (bin, include, lib, etc.), you'll need to specify them
       explicitly.  See also CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH,
       CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH.

  CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
       Path used for searching by FIND_FILE() and FIND_PATH().

       Specifies a path which will be used both by FIND_FILE() and
       FIND_PATH().  Both commands will check each of the contained
       directories for the existence of the file which is currently searched.
       By default it is empty, it is intended to be set by the project.  See
       also CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.

  CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_COMPONENT_NAME
       Default component used in install() commands.

       If an install() command is used without the COMPONENT argument, these
       files will be grouped into a default component.  The name of this
       default install component will be taken from this variable.  It
       defaults to "Unspecified".

  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
       Install directory used by install.

       If "make install" is invoked or INSTALL is built, this directory is
       pre-pended onto all install directories.  This variable defaults to
       /usr/local on UNIX and c:/Program Files on Windows.

       On UNIX one can use the DESTDIR mechanism in order to relocate the
       whole installation.  DESTDIR means DESTination DIRectory.  It is
       commonly used by makefile users in order to install software at
       non-default location.  It is usually invoked like this:

        make DESTDIR=/home/john install

       which will install the concerned software using the installation
       prefix, e.g.  "/usr/local" pre-pended with the DESTDIR value which
       finally gives "/home/john/usr/local".

       WARNING: DESTDIR may not be used on Windows because installation
       prefix usually contains a drive letter like in "C:/Program Files"
       which cannot be pre-pended with some other prefix.

  CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
       Path used for searching by FIND_LIBRARY().

       Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_LIBRARY().  FIND_LIBRARY()
       will check each of the contained directories for the existence of the
       library which is currently searched.  By default it is empty, it is
       intended to be set by the project.  See also
       CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH, CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.

  CMAKE_MFC_FLAG
       Tell cmake to use MFC for an executable or dll.

       This can be set in a CMakeLists.txt file and will enable MFC in the
       application.  It should be set to 1 for the static MFC library, and 2
       for the shared MFC library.  This is used in Visual Studio 6 and 7
       project files.  The CMakeSetup dialog used MFC and the CMakeLists.txt
       looks like this:

         add_definitions(-D_AFXDLL)
         set(CMAKE_MFC_FLAG 2)
         add_executable(CMakeSetup WIN32 ${SRCS})


  CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
       List of directories to search for CMake modules.

       Commands like include() and find_package() search for files in
       directories listed by this variable before checking the default
       modules that come with CMake.

  CMAKE_NOT_USING_CONFIG_FLAGS
       Skip _BUILD_TYPE flags if true.

       This is an internal flag used by the generators in CMake to tell CMake
       to skip the _BUILD_TYPE flags.

  CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP<NNNN>
       Default for CMake Policy CMP<NNNN> when it is otherwise left unset.

       Commands cmake_minimum_required(VERSION) and cmake_policy(VERSION) by
       default leave policies introduced after the given version unset.  Set
       CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP<NNNN> to OLD or NEW to specify the default
       for policy CMP<NNNN>, where <NNNN> is the policy number.

       This variable should not be set by a project in CMake code; use
       cmake_policy(SET) instead.  Users running CMake may set this variable
       in the cache (e.g.  -DCMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP<NNNN>=<OLD|NEW>) to set
       a policy not otherwise set by the project.  Set to OLD to quiet a
       policy warning while using old behavior or to NEW to try building the
       project with new behavior.

  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
       Path used for searching by FIND_XXX(), with appropriate suffixes
       added.

       Specifies a path which will be used by the FIND_XXX() commands.  It
       contains the "base" directories, the FIND_XXX() commands append
       appropriate subdirectories to the base directories.  So FIND_PROGRAM()
       adds /bin to each of the directories in the path, FIND_LIBRARY()
       appends /lib to each of the directories, and FIND_PATH() and
       FIND_FILE() append /include .  By default it is empty, it is intended
       to be set by the project.  See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH,
       CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH, CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH.

  CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH
       Path used for searching by FIND_PROGRAM().

       Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_PROGRAM().  FIND_PROGRAM()
       will check each of the contained directories for the existence of the
       program which is currently searched.  By default it is empty, it is
       intended to be set by the project.  See also
       CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH, CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.

  CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY
       Don't make the install target depend on the all target.

       By default, the "install" target depends on the "all" target.  This
       has the effect, that when "make install" is invoked or INSTALL is
       built, first the "all" target is built, then the installation starts.
       If CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY is set to TRUE, this dependency
       is not created, so the installation process will start immediately,
       independent from whether the project has been completely built or not.

  CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH
       Path to be ignored by FIND_XXX() commands.

       Specifies directories to be ignored by searches in FIND_XXX()
       commands.  This is useful in cross-compiled environments where some
       system directories contain incompatible but possibly linkable
       libraries.  For example, on cross-compiled cluster environments, this
       allows a user to ignore directories containing libraries meant for the
       front-end machine that modules like FindX11 (and others) would
       normally search.  By default this contains a list of directories
       containing incompatible binaries for the host system.  See also
       CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH, CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH,
       CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH, and CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH.

  CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
       Path used for searching by FIND_FILE() and FIND_PATH().

       Specifies a path which will be used both by FIND_FILE() and
       FIND_PATH().  Both commands will check each of the contained
       directories for the existence of the file which is currently searched.
       By default it contains the standard directories for the current
       system.  It is NOT intended to be modified by the project, use
       CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH for this.  See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.

  CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH
       Path used for searching by FIND_LIBRARY().

       Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_LIBRARY().  FIND_LIBRARY()
       will check each of the contained directories for the existence of the
       library which is currently searched.  By default it contains the
       standard directories for the current system.  It is NOT intended to be
       modified by the project, use CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH for this.  See also
       CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.

  CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
       Path used for searching by FIND_XXX(), with appropriate suffixes
       added.

       Specifies a path which will be used by the FIND_XXX() commands.  It
       contains the "base" directories, the FIND_XXX() commands append
       appropriate subdirectories to the base directories.  So FIND_PROGRAM()
       adds /bin to each of the directories in the path, FIND_LIBRARY()
       appends /lib to each of the directories, and FIND_PATH() and
       FIND_FILE() append /include .  By default this contains the standard
       directories for the current system.  It is NOT intended to be modified
       by the project, use CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH for this.  See also
       CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH,
       CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH, and CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH.

  CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH
       Path used for searching by FIND_PROGRAM().

       Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_PROGRAM().  FIND_PROGRAM()
       will check each of the contained directories for the existence of the
       program which is currently searched.  By default it contains the
       standard directories for the current system.  It is NOT intended to be
       modified by the project, use CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH for this.  See also
       CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.

  CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE
       Specify a CMake file that overrides platform information.

       CMake loads the specified file while enabling support for each
       language from either the project() or enable_language() commands.  It
       is loaded after CMake's builtin compiler and platform information
       modules have been loaded but before the information is used.  The file
       may set platform information variables to override CMake's defaults.

       This feature is intended for use only in overriding information
       variables that must be set before CMake builds its first test project
       to check that the compiler for a language works.  It should not be
       used to load a file in cases that a normal include() will work.  Use
       it only as a last resort for behavior that cannot be achieved any
       other way.  For example, one may set CMAKE_C_FLAGS_INIT to change the
       default value used to initialize CMAKE_C_FLAGS before it is cached.
       The override file should NOT be used to set anything that could be set
       after languages are enabled, such as variables like
       CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY that affect the placement of binaries.
       Information set in the file will be used for try_compile and try_run
       builds too.

  CMAKE_WARN_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION
       Ask cmake_install.cmake script to warn each time a file with absolute
       INSTALL DESTINATION is encountered.

       This variable is used by CMake-generated cmake_install.cmake scripts.
       If ones set this variable to ON while running the script, it may get
       warning messages from the script.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Variables That Describe the System

  APPLE
       True if running on Mac OSX.

       Set to true on Mac OSX.

  BORLAND
       True if the borland compiler is being used.

       This is set to true if the Borland compiler is being used.

  CMAKE_CL_64
       Using the 64 bit compiler from Microsoft

       Set to true when using the 64 bit cl compiler from Microsoft.

  CMAKE_COMPILER_2005
       Using the Visual Studio 2005 compiler from Microsoft

       Set to true when using the Visual Studio 2005 compiler from Microsoft.

  CMAKE_HOST_APPLE
       True for Apple OSXoperating systems.

       Set to true when the host system is Apple OSX.

  CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM
       Name of system cmake is being run on.

       The same as CMAKE_SYSTEM but for the host system instead of the target
       system when cross compiling.

  CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME
       Name of the OS CMake is running on.

       The same as CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME but for the host system instead of the
       target system when cross compiling.

  CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR
       The name of the CPU CMake is running on.

       The same as CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR but for the host system instead of
       the target system when cross compiling.

  CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_VERSION
       OS version CMake is running on.

       The same as CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION but for the host system instead of
       the target system when cross compiling.

  CMAKE_HOST_UNIX
       True for UNIX and UNIX like operating systems.

       Set to true when the host system is UNIX or UNIX like (i.e.  APPLE and
       CYGWIN).

  CMAKE_HOST_WIN32
       True on windows systems, including win64.

       Set to true when the host system is Windows and on cygwin.

  CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE
       Target architecture library directory name, if detected.

       This is the value of CMAKE_<lang>_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE as detected for
       one of the enabled languages.

  CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE_REGEX
       Regex matching possible target architecture library directory names.

       This is used to detect CMAKE_<lang>_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE from the
       implicit linker search path by matching the <arch> name.

  CMAKE_OBJECT_PATH_MAX
       Maximum object file full-path length allowed by native build tools.

       CMake computes for every source file an object file name that is
       unique to the source file and deterministic with respect to the full
       path to the source file.  This allows multiple source files in a
       target to share the same name if they lie in different directories
       without rebuilding when one is added or removed.  However, it can
       produce long full paths in a few cases, so CMake shortens the path
       using a hashing scheme when the full path to an object file exceeds a
       limit.  CMake has a built-in limit for each platform that is
       sufficient for common tools, but some native tools may have a lower
       limit.  This variable may be set to specify the limit explicitly.  The
       value must be an integer no less than 128.

  CMAKE_SYSTEM
       Name of system cmake is compiling for.

       This variable is the composite of CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME and
       CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION, like this
       ${CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME}-${CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION}.  If CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION
       is not set, then CMAKE_SYSTEM is the same as CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME.

  CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME
       Name of the OS CMake is building for.

       This is the name of the operating system on which CMake is targeting.
       On systems that have the uname command, this variable is set to the
       output of uname -s.  Linux, Windows, and Darwin for Mac OSX are the
       values found on the big three operating systems.

  CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR
       The name of the CPU CMake is building for.

       On systems that support uname, this variable is set to the output of
       uname -p, on windows it is set to the value of the environment
       variable PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE

  CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION
       OS version CMake is building for.

       A numeric version string for the system, on systems that support
       uname, this variable is set to the output of uname -r.  On other
       systems this is set to major-minor version numbers.

       True when using Microsoft Visual C 6.0

       Set to true when the compiler is version 6.0 of Microsoft Visual C.

  MSVC70
       True when using Microsoft Visual C 7.0

       Set to true when the compiler is version 7.0 of Microsoft Visual C.

  MSVC71
       True when using Microsoft Visual C 7.1

       Set to true when the compiler is version 7.1 of Microsoft Visual C.

  MSVC80
       True when using Microsoft Visual C 8.0

       Set to true when the compiler is version 8.0 of Microsoft Visual C.

       True when using Microsoft Visual C 9.0

       Set to true when the compiler is version 9.0 of Microsoft Visual C.

  MSVC_IDE
       True when using the Microsoft Visual C IDE

       Set to true when the target platform is the Microsoft Visual C IDE, as
       opposed to the command line compiler.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Variables common to all CPack generators

  CPACK_ABSOLUTE_DESTINATION_FILES
       List of files which have been installed using an ABSOLUTE DESTINATION
       path.

       This variable is a Read-Only variable which is set internally by CPack
       during installation and before packaging using
       CMAKE_ABSOLUTE_DESTINATION_FILES defined in cmake_install.cmake
       scripts.  The value can be used within CPack project configuration
       file and/or CPack<GEN>.cmake file of <GEN> generator.

  CPACK_BINARY_<GENNAME>
       CPack generated options for binary generators

       The CPack.cmake module generates (when CPACK_GENERATOR is not set) a
       set of CMake options (see CMake option command) which may then be used
       to select the CPack generator(s) to be used when launching the package
       target.

  CPACK_CMAKE_GENERATOR
       What CMake generator should be used if the project is CMake project.

       Defaults to the value of CMAKE_GENERATOR few users will want to change
       this setting.

  CPACK_COMPONENT_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY
       Boolean toggle to include/exclude top level directory (component
       case).

       Similar usage as CPACK_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY but for the
       component case.  See CPACK_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY documentation
       for the detail.

  CPACK_CREATE_DESKTOP_LINKS
       List of desktop links to create

  CPACK_GENERATOR
       List of CPack generators to use

       If not specified, CPack will create a set of options
       CPACK_BINARY_<GENNAME> (e.g., CPACK_BINARY_NSIS) allowing the user to
       enable/disable individual generators.  This variable may be used on
       the command line as well as in:

           cpack -D CPACK_GENERATOR="ZIP;TGZ" /path/to/build/tree


  CPACK_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY
       Boolean toggle to include/exclude top level directory.

       When preparing a package CPack installs the item under the so-called
       top level directory.  The purpose of is to include (set to 1 or ON or
       TRUE) the top level directory in the package or not (set to 0 or OFF
       or FALSE).

       Each CPack generator as a built-in default value for this variable.
       E.g.  Archive generators (ZIP, TGZ, ...) includes the top level
       whereas RPM or DEB don't.  The user may override the default value by
       setting this variable.

       There is a similar variable CPACK_COMPONENT_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY
       which may be used to override the behavior for the component packaging
       case which may have different default value for historical (now
       backward compatibility) reason.

  CPACK_INSTALLED_DIRECTORIES
       Extra directories to install

  CPACK_INSTALL_CMAKE_PROJECTS
       List of four values that specify what project to install.

       The four values are: Build directory, Project Name, Project Component,
       Directory.  If omitted, CPack will build an installer that installers
       everything.

  CPACK_INSTALL_COMMANDS
       Extra commands to install components

  CPACK_INSTALL_SCRIPT
       Extra CMake script provided by the user.

       If set this CMake script will be executed by CPack during its local
       [CPack-private] installation which is done right before packaging the
       files.  The script is not called by e.g.: make install.

  CPACK_MONOLITHIC_INSTALL
       Disables the component-based installation mechanism.

       When set the component specification is ignored and all installed
       items are put in a single "MONOLITHIC" package.  Some CPack generators
       do monolithic packaging by default and may be asked to do component
       packaging by setting CPACK_<GENNAME>_COMPONENT_INSTALL to 1/TRUE.

  CPACK_OUTPUT_CONFIG_FILE
       The name of the CPack binary configuration file.

       This file is the CPack configuration generated by the CPack module for
       binary installers.  Defaults to CPackConfig.cmake.

  CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_FILE
       A text file used to describe the project.

       Used, for example, the introduction screen of a CPack-generated
       Windows installer to describe the project.

  CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_SUMMARY
       Short description of the project (only a few words).

  CPACK_PACKAGE_DIRECTORY
       The directory in which CPack is doing its packaging.

       If it is not set then this will default (internally) to the build dir.
       This variable may be defined in CPack config file or from the cpack
       command line option "-B".  If set the command line option override the
       value found in the config file.

  CPACK_PACKAGE_EXECUTABLES
       Lists each of the executables and associated text label to be used to
       create Start Menu shortcuts.

       For example, setting this to the list ccmake;CMake will create a
       shortcut named "CMake" that will execute the installed executable
       ccmake.  Not all CPack generators use it (at least NSIS and OSXX11
       do).

  CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME
       The name of the package file to generate, not including the extension.

       For example, cmake-2.6.1-Linux-i686.  The default value is

         ${CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME}-${CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION}-${CPACK_SYSTEM_NAME}.


  CPACK_PACKAGE_ICON
       A branding image that will be displayed inside the installer (used by
       GUI installers).

  CPACK_PACKAGE_INSTALL_DIRECTORY
       Installation directory on the target system.

       This may be used by some CPack generators like NSIS to create an
       installation directory e.g., "CMake 2.5" below the installation
       prefix.  All installed element will be put inside this directory.

  CPACK_PACKAGE_INSTALL_REGISTRY_KEY
       Registry key used when installing this project.

       This is only used by installer for Windows.


  CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME
       The name of the package (or application)

       If not specified, defaults to the project name.

  CPACK_PACKAGE_VENDOR
       The name of the package vendor

       (e.g., "Kitware").

  CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION
       Package full version, used internally

       By default, this is built from CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR,
       CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR, and CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH.

  CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR
       Package major Version

  CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR
       Package minor Version

  CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH
       Package patch Version

  CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX
       The prefix used in the built package.

       Each CPack generator has a default value (like /usr).  This default
       value may be overwritten from the CMakeLists.txt or the cpack command
       line by setting an alternative value.

       e.g.  set(CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX "/opt")

       This is not the same purpose as CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX which is used
       when installing from the build tree without building a package.

  CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE
       CPack-time project CPack configuration file.

       This file included at cpack time, once per generator after CPack has
       set CPACK_GENERATOR to the actual generator being used.  It allows
       per-generator setting of CPACK_* variables at cpack time.

  CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE
       License to be embedded in the installer

       It will typically be displayed to the user by the produced installer
       (often with an explicit "Accept" button, for graphical installers)
       prior to installation.  This license file is NOT added to installed
       file but is used by some CPack generators like NSIS.  If you want to
       install a license file (may be the same as this one) along with your
       project you must add an appropriate CMake INSTALL command in your
       CMakeLists.txt.

  CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_README
       ReadMe file to be embedded in the installer

       It typically describes in some detail the purpose of the project
       during the installation.  Not all CPack generators uses this file.

  CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_WELCOME
       Welcome file to be embedded in the installer.

       It welcomes users to this installer.  Typically used in the graphical
       installers on Windows and Mac OS X.

  CPACK_SET_DESTDIR
       Boolean toggle to make CPack use DESTDIR mechanism when packaging.

       DESTDIR means DESTination DIRectory.  It is commonly used by makefile
       users in order to install software at non-default location.  It is a
       basic relocation mechanism that should not be used on Windows (see
       CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX documentation).  It is usually invoked like this:

        make DESTDIR=/home/john install

       which will install the concerned software using the installation
       prefix, e.g.  "/usr/local" pre-pended with the DESTDIR value which
       finally gives "/home/john/usr/local".  When preparing a package, CPack
       first installs the items to be packaged in a local (to the build tree)
       directory by using the same DESTDIR mechanism.  Nevertheless, if
       CPACK_SET_DESTDIR is set then CPack will set DESTDIR before doing the
       local install.  The most noticeable difference is that without
       CPACK_SET_DESTDIR, CPack uses CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX as a
       prefix whereas with CPACK_SET_DESTDIR set, CPack will use
       CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX as a prefix.

       Manually setting CPACK_SET_DESTDIR may help (or simply be necessary)
       if some install rules uses absolute DESTINATION (see CMake INSTALL
       command).  However, starting with CPack/CMake 2.8.3 RPM and DEB
       installers tries to handle DESTDIR automatically so that it is seldom
       necessary for the user to set it.

  CPACK_SOURCE_GENERATOR
       List of generators used for the source packages.

       As with CPACK_GENERATOR, if this is not specified then CPack will
       create a set of options (e.g., CPACK_SOURCE_ZIP) allowing users to
       select which packages will be generated.

  CPACK_SOURCE_IGNORE_FILES
       Pattern of files in the source tree that won't be packaged when
       building a source package.

       This is a list of regular expression patterns (that must be properly
       escaped), e.g., /CVS/;/\\.svn/;\\.swp$;\\.#;/#;.*~;cscope.*

  CPACK_SOURCE_OUTPUT_CONFIG_FILE
       The name of the CPack source configuration file.

       This file is the CPack configuration generated by the CPack module for
       source installers.  Defaults to CPackSourceConfig.cmake.

  CPACK_SOURCE_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME
       The name of the source package

       For example cmake-2.6.1.

  CPACK_SOURCE_STRIP_FILES
       List of files in the source tree that will be stripped.

       Starting with CMake 2.6.0 CPACK_SOURCE_STRIP_FILES will be a boolean
       variable which enables stripping of all files (a list of files
       evaluates to TRUE in CMake, so this change is compatible).

  CPACK_STRIP_FILES
       List of files to be stripped

       Starting with CMake 2.6.0 CPACK_STRIP_FILES will be a boolean variable
       which enables stripping of all files (a list of files evaluates to
       TRUE in CMake, so this change is compatible).

  CPACK_SYSTEM_NAME
       System name, defaults to the value of ${CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME}.

  CPACK_TOPLEVEL_TAG
       Directory for the installed files

  CPACK_WARN_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION
       Ask CPack to warn each time a file with absolute INSTALL DESTINATION
       is encountered.

       This variable triggers the definition of
       CMAKE_WARN_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION when CPack runs
       cmake_install.cmake scripts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Variables concerning CPack Components

  CPACK_<GENNAME>_COMPONENT_INSTALL
       Enable/Disable component install for CPack generator <GENNAME>.

       Each CPack Generator (RPM, DEB, ARCHIVE, NSIS, DMG, etc...) has a
       legacy default behavior.  e.g.  RPM builds monolithic whereas NSIS
       builds component.  One can change the default behavior by setting this
       variable to 0/1 or OFF/ON.

  CPACK_COMPONENTS_ALL
       The list of component to install

       The default value of this variable is computed by CPack and contains
       all components defined by the project.  The user may set it to only
       include the specified components.

  CPACK_COMPONENTS_GROUPING
       Specify how components are grouped for multi-package component-aware
       CPack generators.

       Some generators like RPM or ARCHIVE family (TGZ, ZIP, ...) generates
       several packages files when asked for component packaging.  They group
       the component differently depending on the value of this variable:

         - ONE_PER_GROUP (default): creates one package file per component group
         - ALL_COMPONENTS_IN_ONE : creates a single package with all (requested) component
         - IGNORE : creates one package per component, i.e. IGNORE component group

       One can specify different grouping for different CPack generator by
       using a CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE.

  CPACK_COMPONENT_<compName>_DEPENDS
       The dependencies (list of components) on which this component depends.

  CPACK_COMPONENT_<compName>_DESCRIPTION
       The description of a component

  CPACK_COMPONENT_<compName>_DISPLAY_NAME
       The name to be displayed for a component

  CPACK_COMPONENT_<compName>_GROUP
       The group of a component

  CPACK_COMPONENT_<compName>_REQUIRED
       True is this component is required

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Variables for Languages

  CMAKE_<LANG>_ARCHIVE_APPEND
       Rule variable to append to a static archive.

       This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to append to a static
       archive.  It is used in place of CMAKE_<LANG>_CREATE_STATIC_LIBRARY on
       some platforms in order to support large object counts.  See also

       CMAKE_<LANG>_ARCHIVE_APPEND and CMAKE_<LANG>_ARCHIVE_FINISH.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_ARCHIVE_FINISH
       Rule variable to finish an existing static archive.

       This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to finish a static
       archive.  It is used in place of CMAKE_<LANG>_CREATE_STATIC_LIBRARY on
       some platforms in order to support large object counts.  See also
       CMAKE_<LANG>_ARCHIVE_CREATE and CMAKE_<LANG>_ARCHIVE_APPEND.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER
       The full path to the compiler for LANG.

       This is the command that will be used as the <LANG> compiler.  Once
       set, you can not change this variable.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ABI
       An internal variable subject to change.

       This is used in determining the compiler ABI and is subject to change.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID

         Watcom = Open Watcom (openwatcom.org)
         XL, VisualAge, zOS = IBM XL (ibm.com)

       This variable is not guaranteed to be defined for all compilers or
       languages.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_LOADED
       Defined to true if the language is enabled.

       When language <LANG> is enabled by project() or enable_language() this
       variable is defined to 1.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION
       Compiler version string.

       Compiler version in major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]] format.  This
       variable is not guaranteed to be defined for all compilers or
       languages.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILE_OBJECT
       Rule variable to compile a single object file.

       This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to compile a single
       object file for for the language <LANG>.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY
       Rule variable to create a shared library.

       This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to create a shared
       library for the language <LANG>.

       library for the language <LANG>.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_DEBUG
       Flags for Debug build type or configuration.

       <LANG> flags used when CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is Debug.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_MINSIZEREL
       Flags for MinSizeRel build type or configuration.

       <LANG> flags used when CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is MinSizeRel.Short for
       minimum size release.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_RELEASE
       Flags for Release build type or configuration.

       <LANG> flags used when CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is Release

  CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO
       Flags for RelWithDebInfo type or configuration.

       <LANG> flags used when CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is RelWithDebInfo.  Short for
       Release With Debug Information.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_IGNORE_EXTENSIONS
       File extensions that should be ignored by the build.

       This is a list of file extensions that may be part of a project for a
       given language but are not compiled.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
       Directories implicitly searched by the compiler for header files.

       CMake does not explicitly specify these directories on compiler
       command lines for language <LANG>.  This prevents system include
       directories from being treated as user include directories on some
       compilers.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_LINK_DIRECTORIES
       Implicit linker search path detected for language <LANG>.

       Compilers typically pass directories containing language runtime
       libraries and default library search paths when they invoke a linker.
       These paths are implicit linker search directories for the compiler's
       language.  CMake automatically detects these directories for each
       language and reports the results in this variable.

       When a library in one of these directories is given by full path to
       target_link_libraries() CMake will generate the -l<name> form on link
       lines to ensure the linker searches its implicit directories for the
       library.  Note that some toolchains read implicit directories from an
       environment variable such as LIBRARY_PATH so keep its value consistent
       when operating in a given build tree.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_LINK_FRAMEWORK_DIRECTORIES
       Implicit linker framework search path detected for language <LANG>.

       These paths are implicit linker framework search directories for the
       compiler's language.  CMake automatically detects these directories
       for each language and reports the results in this variable.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_LINK_LIBRARIES
       Implicit link libraries and flags detected for language <LANG>.

       Compilers typically pass language runtime library names and other
       flags when they invoke a linker.  These flags are implicit link
       options for the compiler's language.  CMake automatically detects
       these libraries and flags for each language and reports the results in
       this variable.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE
       Target architecture library directory name detected for <lang>.

       If the <lang> compiler passes to the linker an architecture-specific
       system library search directory such as <prefix>/lib/<arch> this
       variable contains the <arch> name if/as detected by CMake.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE
       Preference value for linker language selection.

       The "linker language" for executable, shared library, and module
       targets is the language whose compiler will invoke the linker.  The
       LINKER_LANGUAGE target property sets the language explicitly.
       Otherwise, the linker language is that whose linker preference value
       is highest among languages compiled and linked into the target.  See
       also the CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE_PROPAGATES variable.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE_PROPAGATES
       True if CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE propagates across targets.

       This is used when CMake selects a linker language for a target.
       Languages compiled directly into the target are always considered.  A
       language compiled into static libraries linked by the target is
       considered if this variable is true.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_LINK_EXECUTABLE 
       Rule variable to link and executable.

       Rule variable to link and executable for the given language.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_OUTPUT_EXTENSION
       Extension for the output of a compile for a single file.

       This is the extension for an object file for the given <LANG>.  For
       example .obj for C on Windows.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_PLATFORM_ID
       An internal variable subject to change.

       This is used in determining the platform and is subject to change.

  CMAKE_<LANG>_SIZEOF_DATA_PTR
       Size of pointer-to-data types for language <LANG>.

       This holds the size (in bytes) of pointer-to-data types in the target
       platform ABI.  It is defined for languages C and CXX (C++).

  CMAKE_<LANG>_SOURCE_FILE_EXTENSIONS
       Extensions of source files for the given language.

       This is the list of extensions for a given languages source files.

  CMAKE_COMPILER_IS_GNU<LANG>
       True if the compiler is GNU.

       If the selected <LANG> compiler is the GNU compiler then this is TRUE,
       if not it is FALSE.  Unlike the other per-language variables, this
       uses the GNU syntax for identifying languages instead of the CMake
       syntax.  Recognized values of the <LANG> suffix are:

         CC = C compiler
         CXX = C++ compiler
         G77 = Fortran compiler

  CMAKE_Fortran_MODDIR_DEFAULT
       Fortran default module output directory.

       Most Fortran compilers write .mod files to the current working
       directory.  For those that do not, this is set to "." and used when
       the Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY target property is not set.

  CMAKE_Fortran_MODDIR_FLAG
       Fortran flag for module output directory.

       This stores the flag needed to pass the value of the
       Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY target property to the compiler.

  CMAKE_Fortran_MODOUT_FLAG
       Fortran flag to enable module output.

       Most Fortran compilers write .mod files out by default.  For others,
       this stores the flag needed to enable module output.

  CMAKE_INTERNAL_PLATFORM_ABI
       An internal variable subject to change.

       This is used in determining the compiler ABI and is subject to change.

  CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE_<LANG>
       Specify a CMake file that overrides platform information for <LANG>.

       This is a language-specific version of CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE
       loaded only when enabling language <LANG>.

       This variable can be used to override the automatically detected
       command (or specify its location if the auto-detection fails to find
       it.)

  CPACK_COMMAND_REZ
       Path to the Rez(1) command used to compile resources on Mac OS X.

       This variable can be used to override the automatically detected
       command (or specify its location if the auto-detection fails to find

       The disk image format

       Common values are UDRO (UDIF read-only), UDZO (UDIF zlib-compressed)
       or UDBZ (UDIF bzip2-compressed).  Refer to hdiutil(1) for more
       information on other available formats.

  CPACK_OSX_PACKAGE_VERSION
       The version of Mac OS X that the resulting PackageMaker archive should
       be compatible with.

       Different versions of Mac OS X support different features.  For
       example, CPack can only build component-based installers for Mac OS X
       10.4 or newer, and can only build installers that download component
       son-the-fly for Mac OS X 10.5 or newer.  If left blank, this value
       will be set to the minimum version of Mac OS X that supports the
       requested features.  Set this variable to some value (e.g., 10.4) only
       if you want to guarantee that your installer will work on that version
       of Mac OS X, and don't mind missing extra features available in the
       installer shipping with later versions of Mac OS X.

            to build the RPM. For example some Linux distribution now default
            to lzma or xz compression whereas older cannot use such RPM.
            Using this one can enforce compression type to be used.
            Possible value are: lzma, xz, bzip2 and gzip.


  CPACK_RPM_GENERATE_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE_TEMPLATE
       Spec file template

            Mandatory : NO
            Default   : -
            If set CPack will generate a template for USER specified binary
            spec file and stop with an error. For example launch CPack like this
            cpack -D CPACK_RPM_GENERATE_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE_TEMPLATE=1 -G RPM
            The user may then use this file in order to hand-craft is own

            rpm -qp --provides file.rpm


  CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_RELEASE
       The RPM package release

            Mandatory : YES
            Default   : 1
            This is the numbering of the RPM package
            itself, i.e. the version of the packaging and not the version of the
            content (see CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_VERSION). One may change the default
            value if the previous packaging was buggy and/or you want to put here
            a fancy Linux distro specific numbering.


  CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_RELOCATABLE
       build a relocatable RPM

            Mandatory : NO

            be installed using rpm --prefix or --relocate in order to
            install it at an alternate place see rpm(8).
            Note that currently this may fail if CPACK_SET_DESTDIR is set to ON.
            If CPACK_SET_DESTDIR is set then you will get a warning message
            but if there is file installed with absolute path you'll get
            unexpected behavior.


  CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_REQUIRES
       RPM spec requires field

            Mandatory : NO
            Default   : -
            May be used to set RPM dependencies (requires).
            Note that you must enclose the complete requires string between quotes,
            for example:
            set(CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_REQUIRES "python >= 2.5.0, cmake >= 2.8")
            The required package list of an RPM file could be printed with
            rpm -qp --requires file.rpm


  CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_SUGGESTS
       RPM spec suggest field

            Mandatory : NO

         CPACK_RPM_POST_UNINSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE
            Mandatory : NO
            Default   : -
            May be used to embed a post (un)installation script in the spec file.
            The refered script file(s) will be read and directly
            put after the %post or %postun section
            If CPACK_RPM_COMPONENT_INSTALL is set to ON the (un)install script for
            each component can be overridden with
            CPACK_RPM_<COMPONENT>_POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE and
            CPACK_RPM_<COMPONENT>_POST_UNINSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE
            One may verify which scriptlet has been included with

            Mandatory : NO
            Default   : -
            May be used to embed a pre (un)installation script in the spec file.
            The refered script file(s) will be read and directly
            put after the %pre or %preun section
            If CPACK_RPM_COMPONENT_INSTALL is set to ON the (un)install script for
            each component can be overridden with
            CPACK_RPM_<COMPONENT>_PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE and

            This way of specifying post-install script is deprecated use
            CPACK_RPM_POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE
            May be used to set an RPM post-install command inside the spec file.
            For example setting it to "/bin/true" may be used to prevent
            rpmbuild to strip binaries.


  CPACK_RPM_SPEC_MORE_DEFINE

            Mandatory : NO
            Default   : -
            May be used to explicitly specify %(<directive>) file line
            in the spec file. Like %config(noreplace) or any other directive
            that be found in the %files section. Since CPackRPM is generating
            the list of files (and directories) the user specified files of
            the CPACK_RPM_<COMPONENT>_USER_FILELIST list will be removed from the generated list.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Variables specific to CPack WiX generator

  CPACK_WIX_LICENSE_RTF
       RTF License File

       If CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE has an .rtf extension it is used as-is.

       If CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE has an .txt extension it is implicitly
       converted to RTF by the WiX Generator.

       With CPACK_WIX_LICENSE_RTF you can override the license file used by
       the WiX Generator in case CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE is in an
       unsupported format or the .txt -> .rtf conversion does not work as
       expected.


  CPACK_WIX_PRODUCT_GUID
       Product GUID (Product/@Id)

       Will be automatically generated unless explicitly provided.

       If explicitly provided this will set the Product Id of your installer.

       The installer will abort if it detects a pre-existing installation
       that uses the same GUID.

       The GUID shall use the syntax described for CPACK_WIX_UPGRADE_GUID.

  CPACK_WIX_PRODUCT_ICON
       The Icon shown next to the program name in Add/Remove programs

       If set, this icon is used in place of the default icon.


  CPACK_WIX_UI_BANNER
       The bitmap will appear at the top of all installer pages other than
       the welcome and completion dialogs

       If set, this image will replace the default banner image.

       This image must be 493 by 58 pixels.


  CPACK_WIX_UI_DIALOG
       Background bitmap used on the welcome and completion dialogs

       If this variable is set, the installer will replace the default dialog
       image.

       This image must be 493 by 312 pixels.


  CPACK_WIX_UPGRADE_GUID
       Upgrade GUID (Product/@UpgradeCode)

       Will be automatically generated unless explicitly provided.

       It should be explicitly set to a constant generated gloabally unique
       identifier (GUID) to allow your installers to replace existing
       installations that use the same GUID.

       You may for example explicitly set this variable in your
       CMakeLists.txt to the value that has been generated per default.  You
       should not use GUIDs that you did not generate yourself or which may
       belong to other projects.

       A GUID shall have the following fixed length syntax:
       XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX

         (each X represents an uppercase hexadecimal digit)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Variables that Control the Build

  CMAKE_<CONFIG>_POSTFIX
       Default filename postfix for libraries under configuration <CONFIG>.

       When a non-executable target is created its <CONFIG>_POSTFIX target
       property is initialized with the value of this variable if it is set.

  CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
       Where to put all the ARCHIVE targets when built.

       This variable is used to initialize the ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
       property on all the targets.  See that target property for additional
       information.

  CMAKE_AUTOMOC
       Whether to handle moc automatically for Qt targets.

       This variable is used to initialize the AUTOMOC property on all the
       targets.  See that target property for additional information.

  CMAKE_AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS
       Additional options for moc when using automoc (see CMAKE_AUTOMOC).

       This variable is used to initialize the AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS property
       on all the targets.  See that target property for additional
       information.

  CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH
       Use the install path for the RPATH

       Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when building
       executables etc on systems that use RPATH.  When the software is
       installed the executables etc are relinked by CMake to have the
       install RPATH.  If this variable is set to true then the software is
       always built with the install path for the RPATH and does not need to
       be relinked when installed.

  CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX
       See variable CMAKE_<CONFIG>_POSTFIX.

       This variable is a special case of the more-general
       CMAKE_<CONFIG>_POSTFIX variable for the DEBUG configuration.

  CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS
       Linker flags used to create executables.

       Flags used by the linker when creating an executable.

  CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_[CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE]
       Flag used when linking an executable.

       Same as CMAKE_C_FLAGS_* but used by the linker when creating
       executables.

  CMAKE_Fortran_FORMAT
       Set to FIXED or FREE to indicate the Fortran source layout.

       This variable is used to initialize the Fortran_FORMAT property on all
       the targets.  See that target property for additional information.

  CMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY
       Fortran module output directory.

       This variable is used to initialize the Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY
       property on all the targets.  See that target property for additional
       information.

  CMAKE_GNUtoMS
       Convert GNU import libraries (.dll.a) to MS format (.lib).

       This variable is used to initialize the GNUtoMS property on targets
       when they are created.  See that target property for additional
       information.

  CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR
       Automatically add the current source- and build directories to the
       include path.

       If this variable is enabled, CMake automatically adds in each
       directory ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} and ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}
       to the include path for this directory.  These additional include
       directories do not propagate down to subdirectories.  This is useful
       mainly for out-of-source builds, where files generated into the build
       tree are included by files located in the source tree.

       By default CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR is OFF.

  CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR_IN_INTERFACE
       Automatically add the current source- and build directories to the
       INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES.

       If this variable is enabled, CMake automatically adds for each shared
       library target, static library target, module target and executable
       target, ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} and ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR} to
       the INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES.By default
       CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR_IN_INTERFACE is OFF.

  CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR
       Mac OSX directory name for installed targets.

       CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR is used to initialize the INSTALL_NAME_DIR
       property on all targets.  See that target property for more
       information.

  CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH
       The rpath to use for installed targets.

       A semicolon-separated list specifying the rpath to use in installed
       targets (for platforms that support it).  This is used to initialize
       the target property INSTALL_RPATH for all targets.

  CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH
       Add paths to linker search and installed rpath.

       CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH is a boolean that if set to true
       will append directories in the linker search path and outside the
       project to the INSTALL_RPATH.  This is used to initialize the target
       property INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH for all targets.

  CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
       Where to put all the LIBRARY targets when built.

       This variable is used to initialize the LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
       property on all the targets.  See that target property for additional
       information.

  CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH_FLAG
       The flag used to add a library search path to a compiler.

       The flag used to specify a library directory to the compiler.  On most
       compilers this is "-L".

  CMAKE_LINK_DEF_FILE_FLAG  
       Linker flag used to specify a .def file for dll creation.

       The flag used to add a .def file when creating a dll on Windows, this
       is only defined on Windows.

  CMAKE_LINK_DEPENDS_NO_SHARED
       Whether to skip link dependencies on shared library files.

       This variable initializes the LINK_DEPENDS_NO_SHARED property on
       targets when they are created.  See that target property for
       additional information.

  CMAKE_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
       Default value for LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES of targets.

       This variable is used to initialize the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
       property on all the targets.  See that target property for additional
       information.

  CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_FILE_FLAG
       Flag used to link a library specified by a path to its file.

       The flag used before a library file path is given to the linker.  This
       is needed only on very few platforms.

  CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_FLAG
       Flag used to link a library into an executable.

       The flag used to specify a library to link to an executable.  On most
       compilers this is "-l".

  CMAKE_MACOSX_BUNDLE
       Default value for MACOSX_BUNDLE of targets.

       This variable is used to initialize the MACOSX_BUNDLE property on all
       the targets.  See that target property for additional information.

  CMAKE_NO_BUILTIN_CHRPATH
       Do not use the builtin ELF editor to fix RPATHs on installation.

       When an ELF binary needs to have a different RPATH after installation
       than it does in the build tree, CMake uses a builtin editor to change
       the RPATH in the installed copy.  If this variable is set to true then
       CMake will relink the binary before installation instead of using its
       builtin editor.

  CMAKE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
       Where to put all the MS debug symbol files.

       This variable is used to initialize the PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY property
       on all the targets.  See that target property for additional
       information.

  CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE
       Default value for POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE of targets.

       This variable is used to initialize the POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE
       property on all the targets.  See that target property for additional
       information.

  CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
       Where to put all the RUNTIME targets when built.

       This variable is used to initialize the RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
       property on all the targets.  See that target property for additional
       information.

  CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH
       Do not include RPATHs in the build tree.

       Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when building
       executables etc on systems that use RPATH.  When the software is
       installed the executables etc are relinked by CMake to have the
       install RPATH.  If this variable is set to true then the software is
       always built with no RPATH.

  CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH
       Do not include RPATHs in the install tree.

       Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when building
       executables etc on systems that use RPATH.  When the software is
       installed the executables etc are relinked by CMake to have the
       install RPATH.  If this variable is set to true then the software is
       always installed without RPATH, even if RPATH is enabled when
       building.  This can be useful for example to allow running tests from
       the build directory with RPATH enabled before the installation step.
       To omit RPATH in both the build and install steps, use
       CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH instead.

  CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_CONFIGURATION
       Build configuration used for try_compile and try_run projects.

       Projects built by try_compile and try_run are built synchronously
       during the CMake configuration step.  Therefore a specific build
       configuration must be chosen even if the generated build system
       supports multiple configurations.

  CMAKE_USE_RELATIVE_PATHS
       Use relative paths (May not work!).

       If this is set to TRUE, then the CMake will use relative paths between
       the source and binary tree.  This option does not work for more
       complicated projects, and relative paths are used when possible.  In
       general, it is not possible to move CMake generated makefiles to a
       different location regardless of the value of this variable.

  CMAKE_WIN32_EXECUTABLE
       Default value for WIN32_EXECUTABLE of targets.

       This variable is used to initialize the WIN32_EXECUTABLE property on
       all the targets.  See that target property for additional information.

  EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH
       Old executable location variable.

       The target property RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY supercedes this variable
       for a target if it is set.  Executable targets are otherwise placed in
       this directory.

  LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH
       Old library location variable.

       The target properties ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY,
       LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, and RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY supercede this
       variable for a target if they are set.  Library targets are otherwise
       placed in this directory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Variables that Provide Information

  CMAKE_AR
       Name of archiving tool for static libraries.

       This specifies name of the program that creates archive or static
       libraries.

  CMAKE_ARGC
       Number of command line arguments passed to CMake in script mode.

       When run in -P script mode, CMake sets this variable to the number of
       command line arguments.  See also CMAKE_ARGV0, 1, 2 ...

  CMAKE_ARGV0
       Command line argument passed to CMake in script mode.

       When run in -P script mode, CMake sets this variable to the first
       command line argument.  It then also sets CMAKE_ARGV1, CMAKE_ARGV2,
       ...  and so on, up to the number of command line arguments given.  See
       also CMAKE_ARGC.

  CMAKE_BINARY_DIR
       The path to the top level of the build tree.

       This is the full path to the top level of the current CMake build
       tree.  For an in-source build, this would be the same as
       CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR.

  CMAKE_BUILD_TOOL
       Tool used for the actual build process.

       This variable is set to the program that will be needed to build the
       output of CMake.  If the generator selected was Visual Studio 6, the
       CMAKE_BUILD_TOOL will be set to msdev, for Unix makefiles it will be
       set to make or gmake, and for Visual Studio 7 it set to devenv.  For
       Nmake Makefiles the value is nmake.  This can be useful for adding
       special flags and commands based on the final build environment.

  CMAKE_CACHEFILE_DIR
       The directory with the CMakeCache.txt file.

       This is the full path to the directory that has the CMakeCache.txt
       file in it.  This is the same as CMAKE_BINARY_DIR.

  CMAKE_CACHE_MAJOR_VERSION
       Major version of CMake used to create the CMakeCache.txt file

       This is stores the major version of CMake used to write a CMake cache
       file.  It is only different when a different version of CMake is run
       on a previously created cache file.

  CMAKE_CACHE_MINOR_VERSION
       Minor version of CMake used to create the CMakeCache.txt file

       This is stores the minor version of CMake used to write a CMake cache
       file.  It is only different when a different version of CMake is run
       on a previously created cache file.

  CMAKE_CACHE_PATCH_VERSION
       Patch version of CMake used to create the CMakeCache.txt file

       This is stores the patch version of CMake used to write a CMake cache
       file.  It is only different when a different version of CMake is run
       on a previously created cache file.

  CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR
       Build-time reference to per-configuration output subdirectory.

       For native build systems supporting multiple configurations in the
       build tree (such as Visual Studio and Xcode), the value is a reference
       to a build-time variable specifying the name of the per-configuration
       output subdirectory.  On Makefile generators this evaluates to "."
       because there is only one configuration in a build tree.  Example
       values:

         $(IntDir)        = Visual Studio 6
         $(OutDir)        = Visual Studio 7, 8, 9
         $(Configuration) = Visual Studio 10
         $(CONFIGURATION) = Xcode
         .                = Make-based tools

       Since these values are evaluated by the native build system, this
       variable is suitable only for use in command lines that will be
       evaluated at build time.  Example of intended usage:

         add_executable(mytool mytool.c)
         add_custom_command(
           OUTPUT out.txt
           COMMAND ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool
                   ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/in.txt out.txt
           DEPENDS mytool in.txt
           )
         add_custom_target(drive ALL DEPENDS out.txt)

       Note that CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR is no longer necessary for this purpose but
       has been left for compatibility with existing projects.  Instead
       add_custom_command() recognizes executable target names in its COMMAND
       option, so "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool"
       can be replaced by just "mytool".

       This variable is read-only.  Setting it is undefined behavior.  In
       multi-configuration build systems the value of this variable is passed
       as the value of preprocessor symbol "CMAKE_INTDIR" to the compilation
       of all source files.

  CMAKE_COMMAND
       The full path to the cmake executable.

       This is the full path to the CMake executable cmake which is useful
       from custom commands that want to use the cmake -E option for portable
       system commands.  (e.g.  /usr/local/bin/cmake

  CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING
       Is CMake currently cross compiling.

       This variable will be set to true by CMake if CMake is cross
       compiling.  Specifically if the build platform is different from the
       target platform.

  CMAKE_CTEST_COMMAND
       Full path to ctest command installed with cmake.

       This is the full path to the CTest executable ctest which is useful
       from custom commands that want to use the cmake -E option for portable
       system commands.

  CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR
       The path to the binary directory currently being processed.

       This the full path to the build directory that is currently being
       processed by cmake.  Each directory added by add_subdirectory will
       create a binary directory in the build tree, and as it is being
       processed this variable will be set.  For in-source builds this is the
       current source directory being processed.

  CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR
       Full directory of the listfile currently being processed.

       As CMake processes the listfiles in your project this variable will
       always be set to the directory where the listfile which is currently
       being processed (CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE) is located.  The value has
       dynamic scope.  When CMake starts processing commands in a source file
       it sets this variable to the directory where this file is located.
       When CMake finishes processing commands from the file it restores the
       previous value.  Therefore the value of the variable inside a macro or
       function is the directory of the file invoking the bottom-most entry
       on the call stack, not the directory of the file containing the macro
       or function definition.

       See also CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE.

  CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE
       Full path to the listfile currently being processed.

       As CMake processes the listfiles in your project this variable will
       always be set to the one currently being processed.  The value has
       dynamic scope.  When CMake starts processing commands in a source file
       it sets this variable to the location of the file.  When CMake
       finishes processing commands from the file it restores the previous
       value.  Therefore the value of the variable inside a macro or function
       is the file invoking the bottom-most entry on the call stack, not the
       file containing the macro or function definition.

       See also CMAKE_PARENT_LIST_FILE.

  CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_LINE
       The line number of the current file being processed.

       This is the line number of the file currently being processed by
       cmake.

  CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR
       The path to the source directory currently being processed.

       This the full path to the source directory that is currently being
       processed by cmake.

       -ldl on most UNIX machines.

  CMAKE_EDIT_COMMAND
       Full path to cmake-gui or ccmake.

       This is the full path to the CMake executable that can graphically
       edit the cache.  For example, cmake-gui, ccmake, or cmake -i.

  CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX
       The suffix for executables on this platform.

       The suffix to use for the end of an executable if any, .exe on
       Windows.

       CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX_<LANG> overrides this for language <LANG>.

  CMAKE_EXTRA_GENERATOR
       The extra generator used to build the project.

       When using the Eclipse, CodeBlocks or KDevelop generators, CMake
       generates Makefiles (CMAKE_GENERATOR) and additionally project files
       for the respective IDE.  This IDE project file generator is stored in
       CMAKE_EXTRA_GENERATOR (e.g.  "Eclipse CDT4").

  CMAKE_EXTRA_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES
       Additional suffixes for shared libraries.

       Extensions for shared libraries other than that specified by
       CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX, if any.  CMake uses this to recognize
       external shared library files during analysis of libraries linked by a
       target.

  CMAKE_GENERATOR
       The generator used to build the project.

       The name of the generator that is being used to generate the build
       files.  (e.g.  "Unix Makefiles", "Visual Studio 6", etc.)

  CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET
       Native build system toolset name specified by user.

       Some CMake generators support a toolset name to be given to the native
       build system to choose a compiler.  If the user specifies a toolset
       name (e.g.  via the cmake -T option) the value will be available in
       this variable.

  CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY

       This specifies the minor version of the CMake executable being run.

  CMAKE_PARENT_LIST_FILE
       Full path to the parent listfile of the one currently being processed.

       As CMake processes the listfiles in your project this variable will
       always be set to the listfile that included or somehow invoked the one
       currently being processed.  See also CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE.

  CMAKE_PATCH_VERSION
       The patch version of cmake (i.e.  the 3 in X.X.3).

       This specifies the patch version of the CMake executable being run.

       not used on Windows, but may be present.

  CMAKE_ROOT
       Install directory for running cmake.

       This is the install root for the running CMake and the Modules
       directory can be found here.  This is commonly used in this format:
       ${CMAKE_ROOT}/Modules

  CMAKE_SCRIPT_MODE_FILE
       Full path to the -P script file currently being processed.

       When run in -P script mode, CMake sets this variable to the full path
       of the script file.  When run to configure a CMakeLists.txt file, this
       variable is not set.

  CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_PREFIX
       The prefix for shared libraries that you link to.

       The prefix to use for the name of a shared library, lib on UNIX.

       CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_PREFIX_<LANG> overrides this for language <LANG>.

  CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P
       Size of a void pointer.

       This is set to the size of a pointer on the machine, and is determined
       by a try compile.  If a 64 bit size is found, then the library search
       path is modified to look for 64 bit libraries first.

  CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH
       If true, do not add run time path information.

       If this is set to TRUE, then the rpath information is not added to
       compiled executables.  The default is to add rpath information if the
       platform supports it.  This allows for easy running from the build
       tree.  To omit RPATH in the install step, but not the build step, use
       CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH instead.

  CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR
       The path to the top level of the source tree.

       This is the full path to the top level of the current CMake source

       The suffix to use for the end of a static library, .lib on Windows.

       CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_SUFFIX_<LANG> overrides this for language <LANG>.

  CMAKE_TWEAK_VERSION
       The tweak version of cmake (i.e.  the 1 in X.X.X.1).

       This specifies the tweak version of the CMake executable being run.
       Releases use tweak < 20000000 and development versions use the date
       format CCYYMMDD for the tweak level.

  CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE
       Create verbose makefiles if on.

       This variable defaults to false.  You can set this variable to true to
       make CMake produce verbose makefiles that show each command line as it
       is used.

  CMAKE_VERSION
       The full version of cmake in major.minor.patch[.tweak[-id]] format.

       This specifies the full version of the CMake executable being run.
       This variable is defined by versions 2.6.3 and higher.  See variables
       CMAKE_MAJOR_VERSION, CMAKE_MINOR_VERSION, CMAKE_PATCH_VERSION, and
       CMAKE_TWEAK_VERSION for individual version components.  The [-id]
       component appears in non-release versions and may be arbitrary text.

  CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET
       Visual Studio Platform Toolset name.

       VS 10 and above use MSBuild under the hood and support multiple
       compiler toolchains.  CMake may specify a toolset explicitly, such as
       "v110" for VS 11 or "Windows7.1SDK" for 64-bit support in VS 10
       Express.  CMake provides the name of the chosen toolset in this
       variable.

  CMAKE_XCODE_PLATFORM_TOOLSET
       Xcode compiler selection.

       Xcode supports selection of a compiler from one of the installed
       toolsets.  CMake provides the name of the chosen toolset in this
       variable, if any is explicitly selected (e.g.  via the cmake -T
       option).

  PROJECT_BINARY_DIR
       Full path to build directory for project.

       This is the binary directory of the most recent PROJECT command.

  PROJECT_NAME
       Name of the project given to the project command.

       This is the name given to the most recent PROJECT command.

  PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR
       Top level source directory for the current project.

       This is the source directory of the most recent PROJECT command.

  [Project name]_BINARY_DIR
       Top level binary directory for the named project.

       A variable is created with the name used in the PROJECT command, and
       is the binary directory for the project.  This can be useful when
       SUBDIR is used to connect several projects.

  [Project name]_SOURCE_DIR
       Top level source directory for the named project.

       A variable is created with the name used in the PROJECT command, and
       is the source directory for the project.  This can be useful when
       add_subdirectory is used to connect several projects.
