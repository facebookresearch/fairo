.SH NAME
.PP
cmakemodules \- Reference of available CMake modules.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The "cmake" executable is the CMake command\-line interface.  It may be used to configure projects in scripts.  Project configuration settings may be specified on the command line with the \-D option.  The \-i option will cause cmake to interactively prompt for such settings.

.PP
CMake is a cross\-platform build system generator.  Projects specify their build process with platform\-independent CMake listfiles included in each directory of a source tree with the name CMakeLists.txt. Users build a project by using CMake to generate a build system for a native tool on their platform.

.SH MODULES
.PP
The following modules are provided with CMake. They can be used with INCLUDE(ModuleName).

.PP
This is the documentation for the modules and scripts coming with CMake. Using these modules you can check the computer system for installed software packages, features of the compiler and the existance of headers to name just a few.

.TP
.B AddFileDependencies
ADD_FILE_DEPENDENCIES(source_file depend_files...)

Adds the given files as dependencies to source_file


.TP
.B BundleUtilities
Functions to help assemble a standalone bundle application.

A collection of CMake utility functions useful for dealing with .app bundles on the Mac and bundle\-like directories on any OS.


The following functions are provided by this module:


.nf
   fixup_bundle
   copy_and_fixup_bundle
   verify_app
   get_bundle_main_executable
   get_dotapp_dir
   get_bundle_and_executable
   get_bundle_all_executables
   get_item_key
   clear_bundle_keys
   set_bundle_key_values
   get_bundle_keys
   copy_resolved_item_into_bundle
   copy_resolved_framework_into_bundle
   fixup_bundle_item
   verify_bundle_prerequisites
   verify_bundle_symlinks
.fi

Requires CMake 2.6 or greater because it uses function, break and PARENT_SCOPE. Also depends on GetPrerequisites.cmake.


.nf
  FIXUP_BUNDLE(<app> <libs> <dirs>)
.fi

Fix up a bundle in\-place and make it standalone, such that it can be drag\-n\-drop copied to another machine and run on that machine as long as all of the system libraries are compatible.


If you pass plugins to fixup_bundle as the libs parameter, you should install them or copy them into the bundle before calling fixup_bundle. The "libs" parameter is a list of libraries that must be fixed up, but that cannot be determined by otool output analysis. (i.e., plugins)


Gather all the keys for all the executables and libraries in a bundle, and then, for each key, copy each prerequisite into the bundle. Then fix each one up according to its own list of prerequisites.


Then clear all the keys and call verify_app on the final bundle to ensure that it is truly standalone.


.nf
  COPY_AND_FIXUP_BUNDLE(<src> <dst> <libs> <dirs>)
.fi

Makes a copy of the bundle <src> at location <dst> and then fixes up the new copied bundle in\-place at <dst>...


.nf
  VERIFY_APP(<app>)
.fi

Verifies that an application <app> appears valid based on running analysis tools on it. Calls "message(FATAL_ERROR" if the application is not verified.


.nf
  GET_BUNDLE_MAIN_EXECUTABLE(<bundle> <result_var>)
.fi

The result will be the full path name of the bundle's main executable file or an "error:" prefixed string if it could not be determined.


.nf
  GET_DOTAPP_DIR(<exe> <dotapp_dir_var>)
.fi

Returns the nearest parent dir whose name ends with ".app" given the full path to an executable. If there is no such parent dir, then simply return the dir containing the executable.


The returned directory may or may not exist.


.nf
  GET_BUNDLE_AND_EXECUTABLE(<app> <bundle_var> <executable_var> <valid_var>)
.fi

Takes either a ".app" directory name or the name of an executable nested inside a ".app" directory and returns the path to the ".app" directory in <bundle_var> and the path to its main executable in <executable_var>


.nf
  GET_BUNDLE_ALL_EXECUTABLES(<bundle> <exes_var>)
.fi

Scans the given bundle recursively for all executable files and accumulates them into a variable.


.nf
  GET_ITEM_KEY(<item> <key_var>)
.fi

Given a file (item) name, generate a key that should be unique considering the set of libraries that need copying or fixing up to make a bundle standalone. This is essentially the file name including extension with "." replaced by "_"


This key is used as a prefix for CMake variables so that we can associate a set of variables with a given item based on its key.


.nf
  CLEAR_BUNDLE_KEYS(<keys_var>)
.fi

Loop over the list of keys, clearing all the variables associated with each key. After the loop, clear the list of keys itself.


Caller of get_bundle_keys should call clear_bundle_keys when done with list of keys.


.nf
  SET_BUNDLE_KEY_VALUES(<keys_var> <context> <item> <exepath> <dirs>
                        <copyflag>)
.fi

Add a key to the list (if necessary) for the given item. If added, also set all the variables associated with that key.


.nf
  GET_BUNDLE_KEYS(<app> <libs> <dirs> <keys_var>)
.fi

Loop over all the executable and library files within the bundle (and given as extra <libs>) and accumulate a list of keys representing them. Set values associated with each key such that we can loop over all of them and copy prerequisite libs into the bundle and then do appropriate install_name_tool fixups.


.nf
  COPY_RESOLVED_ITEM_INTO_BUNDLE(<resolved_item> <resolved_embedded_item>)
.fi

Copy a resolved item into the bundle if necessary. Copy is not necessary if the resolved_item is "the same as" the resolved_embedded_item.


.nf
  COPY_RESOLVED_FRAMEWORK_INTO_BUNDLE(<resolved_item> <resolved_embedded_item>)
.fi

Copy a resolved framework into the bundle if necessary. Copy is not necessary if the resolved_item is "the same as" the resolved_embedded_item.


By default, BU_COPY_FULL_FRAMEWORK_CONTENTS is not set. If you want full frameworks embedded in your bundles, set BU_COPY_FULL_FRAMEWORK_CONTENTS to ON before calling fixup_bundle. By default, COPY_RESOLVED_FRAMEWORK_INTO_BUNDLE copies the framework dylib itself plus the framework Resources directory.


.nf
  FIXUP_BUNDLE_ITEM(<resolved_embedded_item> <exepath> <dirs>)
.fi

Get the direct/non\-system prerequisites of the resolved embedded item. For each prerequisite, change the way it is referenced to the value of the _EMBEDDED_ITEM keyed variable for that prerequisite. (Most likely changing to an "@executable_path" style reference.)


This function requires that the resolved_embedded_item be "inside" the bundle already. In other words, if you pass plugins to fixup_bundle as the libs parameter, you should install them or copy them into the bundle before calling fixup_bundle. The "libs" parameter is a list of libraries that must be fixed up, but that cannot be determined by otool output analysis. (i.e., plugins)


Also, change the id of the item being fixed up to its own _EMBEDDED_ITEM value.


Accumulate changes in a local variable and make *one* call to install_name_tool at the end of the function with all the changes at once.


If the BU_CHMOD_BUNDLE_ITEMS variable is set then bundle items will be marked writable before install_name_tool tries to change them.


.nf
  VERIFY_BUNDLE_PREREQUISITES(<bundle> <result_var> <info_var>)
.fi

Verifies that the sum of all prerequisites of all files inside the bundle are contained within the bundle or are "system" libraries, presumed to exist everywhere.


.nf
  VERIFY_BUNDLE_SYMLINKS(<bundle> <result_var> <info_var>)
.fi

Verifies that any symlinks found in the bundle point to other files that are already also in the bundle... Anything that points to an external file causes this function to fail the verification.

.TP
.B CMakeAddFortranSubdirectory
Use MinGW gfortran from VS if a fortran compiler is not found.

The 'add_fortran_subdirectory' function adds a subdirectory to a project that contains a fortran only sub\-project. The module will check the current compiler and see if it can support fortran. If no fortran compiler is found and the compiler is MSVC, then this module will find the MinGW gfortran.  It will then use an external project to build with the MinGW tools.  It will also create imported targets for the libraries created.  This will only work if the fortran code is built into a dll, so BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is turned on in the project.  In addition the CMAKE_GNUtoMS option is set to on, so that the MS .lib files are created. Usage is as follows:


.nf
  cmake_add_fortran_subdirectory(
   <subdir>                # name of subdirectory
   PROJECT <project_name>  # project name in subdir top CMakeLists.txt
   ARCHIVE_DIR <dir>       # dir where project places .lib files
   RUNTIME_DIR <dir>       # dir where project places .dll files
   LIBRARIES <lib>...      # names of library targets to import
   LINK_LIBRARIES          # link interface libraries for LIBRARIES
    [LINK_LIBS <lib> <dep>...]...
   CMAKE_COMMAND_LINE ...  # extra command line flags to pass to cmake
   NO_EXTERNAL_INSTALL     # skip installation of external project
   )
.fi

Relative paths in ARCHIVE_DIR and RUNTIME_DIR are interpreted with respect to the build directory corresponding to the source directory in which the function is invoked.


Limitations:


NO_EXTERNAL_INSTALL is required for forward compatibility with a future version that supports installation of the external project binaries during "make install".

.TP
.B CMakeBackwardCompatibilityCXX
define a bunch of backwards compatibility variables

.nf
  CMAKE_ANSI_CXXFLAGS \- flag for ansi c++
  CMAKE_HAS_ANSI_STRING_STREAM \- has <strstream>
  include(TestForANSIStreamHeaders)
  include(CheckIncludeFileCXX)
  include(TestForSTDNamespace)
  include(TestForANSIForScope)
.fi

.TP
.B CMakeDependentOption
Macro to provide an option dependent on other options.

This macro presents an option to the user only if a set of other conditions are true.  When the option is not presented a default value is used, but any value set by the user is preserved for when the option is presented again. Example invocation:


.nf
  CMAKE_DEPENDENT_OPTION(USE_FOO "Use Foo" ON
                         "USE_BAR;NOT USE_ZOT" OFF)
.fi

If USE_BAR is true and USE_ZOT is false, this provides an option called USE_FOO that defaults to ON.  Otherwise, it sets USE_FOO to OFF.  If the status of USE_BAR or USE_ZOT ever changes, any value for the USE_FOO option is saved so that when the option is re\-enabled it retains its old value.

.TP
.B CMakeDetermineVSServicePack
Includes a public function for assisting users in trying to determine the

Visual Studio service pack in use.


Sets the passed in variable to one of the following values or an empty string if unknown.


.nf
    vc80
    vc80sp1
    vc90
    vc90sp1
    vc100
    vc100sp1
    vc110
.fi




Usage: ===========================


.nf
    if(MSVC)
       include(CMakeDetermineVSServicePack)
       DetermineVSServicePack( my_service_pack )
.fi




.nf
       if( my_service_pack )
           message(STATUS "Detected: ${my_service_pack}")
       endif()
    endif()
.fi

.TP
.B CMakeExpandImportedTargets
.nf
 
.fi

CMAKE_EXPAND_IMPORTED_TARGETS(<var> LIBRARIES lib1 lib2...libN


.nf
                                     [CONFIGURATION <config>] )
.fi




CMAKE_EXPAND_IMPORTED_TARGETS() takes a list of libraries and replaces all imported targets contained in this list with their actual file paths of the referenced libraries on disk, including the libraries from their link interfaces. If a CONFIGURATION is given, it uses the respective configuration of the imported targets if it exists. If no CONFIGURATION is given, it uses the first configuration from ${CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES} if set, otherwise ${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}. This macro is used by all Check*.cmake files which use try_compile() or try_run() and support CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES , so that these checks support imported targets in CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES:


.nf
    cmake_expand_imported_targets(expandedLibs LIBRARIES ${CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES}
                                               CONFIGURATION "${CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_CONFIGURATION}" )
.fi

.TP
.B CMakeFindFrameworks
helper module to find OSX frameworks

.TP
.B CMakeFindPackageMode
.nf
 
.fi

This file is executed by cmake when invoked with \-\-find\-package. It expects that the following variables are set using \-D:


.nf
   NAME = name of the package
   COMPILER_ID = the CMake compiler ID for which the result is, i.e. GNU/Intel/Clang/MSVC, etc.
   LANGUAGE = language for which the result will be used, i.e. C/CXX/Fortan/ASM
   MODE = EXIST : only check for existance of the given package
          COMPILE : print the flags needed for compiling an object file which uses the given package
          LINK : print the flags needed for linking when using the given package
   QUIET = if TRUE, don't print anything
.fi

.TP
.B CMakeForceCompiler
.nf
 
.fi

This module defines macros intended for use by cross\-compiling toolchain files when CMake is not able to automatically detect the compiler identification.


Macro CMAKE_FORCE_C_COMPILER has the following signature:


.nf
   CMAKE_FORCE_C_COMPILER(<compiler> <compiler\-id>)
.fi

It sets CMAKE_C_COMPILER to the given compiler and the cmake internal variable CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID to the given compiler\-id. It also bypasses the check for working compiler and basic compiler information tests.


Macro CMAKE_FORCE_CXX_COMPILER has the following signature:


.nf
   CMAKE_FORCE_CXX_COMPILER(<compiler> <compiler\-id>)
.fi

It sets CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER to the given compiler and the cmake internal variable CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID to the given compiler\-id. It also bypasses the check for working compiler and basic compiler information tests.


Macro CMAKE_FORCE_Fortran_COMPILER has the following signature:


.nf
   CMAKE_FORCE_Fortran_COMPILER(<compiler> <compiler\-id>)
.fi

It sets CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER to the given compiler and the cmake internal variable CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER_ID to the given compiler\-id. It also bypasses the check for working compiler and basic compiler information tests.


So a simple toolchain file could look like this:


.nf
   include (CMakeForceCompiler)
   set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Generic)
   CMAKE_FORCE_C_COMPILER   (chc12 MetrowerksHicross)
   CMAKE_FORCE_CXX_COMPILER (chc12 MetrowerksHicross)
.fi

.TP
.B CMakePackageConfigHelpers
CONFIGURE_PACKAGE_CONFIG_FILE(), WRITE_BASIC_PACKAGE_VERSION_FILE()




.nf
    CONFIGURE_PACKAGE_CONFIG_FILE(<input> <output> INSTALL_DESTINATION <path>
                                                   [PATH_VARS <var1> <var2> ... <varN>]
                                                   [NO_SET_AND_CHECK_MACRO]
                                                   [NO_CHECK_REQUIRED_COMPONENTS_MACRO])
.fi




CONFIGURE_PACKAGE_CONFIG_FILE() should be used instead of the plain configure_file() command when creating the <Name>Config.cmake or <Name>\-config.cmake file for installing a project or library. It helps making the resulting package relocatable by avoiding hardcoded paths in the installed Config.cmake file.


In a FooConfig.cmake file there may be code like this to make the install destinations know to the using project:


.nf
   set(FOO_INCLUDE_DIR   "@CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_INCLUDEDIR@" )
   set(FOO_DATA_DIR   "@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/@RELATIVE_DATA_INSTALL_DIR@" )
   set(FOO_ICONS_DIR   "@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/share/icons" )
   ...logic to determine installedPrefix from the own location...
   set(FOO_CONFIG_DIR  "${installedPrefix}/@CONFIG_INSTALL_DIR@" )
.fi

All 4 options shown above are not sufficient, since the first 3 hardcode the absolute directory locations, and the 4th case works only if the logic to determine the installedPrefix is correct, and if CONFIG_INSTALL_DIR contains a relative path, which in general cannot be guaranteed. This has the effect that the resulting FooConfig.cmake file would work poorly under Windows and OSX, where users are used to choose the install location of a binary package at install time, independent from how CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX was set at build/cmake time.


Using CONFIGURE_PACKAGE_CONFIG_FILE() helps. If used correctly, it makes the resulting FooConfig.cmake file relocatable. Usage:


.nf
   1. write a FooConfig.cmake.in file as you are used to
   2. insert a line containing only the string "@PACKAGE_INIT@"
   3. instead of set(FOO_DIR "@SOME_INSTALL_DIR@"), use set(FOO_DIR "@PACKAGE_SOME_INSTALL_DIR@")
      (this must be after the @PACKAGE_INIT@ line)
   4. instead of using the normal configure_file(), use CONFIGURE_PACKAGE_CONFIG_FILE()
.fi




The <input> and <output> arguments are the input and output file, the same way as in configure_file().


The <path> given to INSTALL_DESTINATION must be the destination where the FooConfig.cmake file will be installed to. This can either be a relative or absolute path, both work.


The variables <var1> to <varN> given as PATH_VARS are the variables which contain install destinations. For each of them the macro will create a helper variable PACKAGE_<var...>. These helper variables must be used in the FooConfig.cmake.in file for setting the installed location. They are calculated by CONFIGURE_PACKAGE_CONFIG_FILE() so that they are always relative to the installed location of the package. This works both for relative and also for absolute locations. For absolute locations it works only if the absolute location is a subdirectory of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.


By default configure_package_config_file() also generates two helper macros, set_and_check() and check_required_components() into the FooConfig.cmake file.


set_and_check() should be used instead of the normal set() command for setting directories and file locations. Additionally to setting the variable it also checks that the referenced file or directory actually exists and fails with a FATAL_ERROR otherwise. This makes sure that the created FooConfig.cmake file does not contain wrong references. When using the NO_SET_AND_CHECK_MACRO, this macro is not generated into the FooConfig.cmake file.


check_required_components(<package_name>) should be called at the end of the FooConfig.cmake file if the package supports components. This macro checks whether all requested, non\-optional components have been found, and if this is not the case, sets the Foo_FOUND variable to FALSE, so that the package is considered to be not found. It does that by testing the Foo_<Component>_FOUND variables for all requested required components. When using the NO_CHECK_REQUIRED_COMPONENTS option, this macro is not generated into the FooConfig.cmake file.


For an example see below the documentation for WRITE_BASIC_PACKAGE_VERSION_FILE().





.nf
  WRITE_BASIC_PACKAGE_VERSION_FILE( filename VERSION major.minor.patch COMPATIBILITY (AnyNewerVersion|SameMajorVersion|ExactVersion) )
.fi




Writes a file for use as <package>ConfigVersion.cmake file to <filename>. See the documentation of find_package() for details on this.


.nf
    filename is the output filename, it should be in the build tree.
    major.minor.patch is the version number of the project to be installed
.fi

The COMPATIBILITY mode AnyNewerVersion means that the installed package version will be considered compatible if it is newer or exactly the same as the requested version. This mode should be used for packages which are fully backward compatible, also across major versions. If SameMajorVersion is used instead, then the behaviour differs from AnyNewerVersion in that the major version number must be the same as requested, e.g. version 2.0 will not be considered compatible if 1.0 is requested. This mode should be used for packages which guarantee backward compatibility within the same major version. If ExactVersion is used, then the package is only considered compatible if the requested version matches exactly its own version number (not considering the tweak version). For example, version 1.2.3 of a package is only considered compatible to requested version 1.2.3. This mode is for packages without compatibility guarantees. If your project has more elaborated version matching rules, you will need to write your own custom ConfigVersion.cmake file instead of using this macro.


Internally, this macro executes configure_file() to create the resulting version file. Depending on the COMPATIBLITY, either the file BasicConfigVersion\-SameMajorVersion.cmake.in or BasicConfigVersion\-AnyNewerVersion.cmake.in is used. Please note that these two files are internal to CMake and you should not call configure_file() on them yourself, but they can be used as starting point to create more sophisticted custom ConfigVersion.cmake files.





Example using both configure_package_config_file() and write_basic_package_version_file(): CMakeLists.txt:


.nf
   set(INCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR include/ ... CACHE )
   set(LIB_INSTALL_DIR lib/ ... CACHE )
   set(SYSCONFIG_INSTALL_DIR etc/foo/ ... CACHE )
   ...
   include(CMakePackageConfigHelpers)
   configure_package_config_file(FooConfig.cmake.in ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/FooConfig.cmake
                                 INSTALL_DESTINATION ${LIB_INSTALL_DIR}/Foo/cmake
                                 PATH_VARS INCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR SYSCONFIG_INSTALL_DIR)
   write_basic_package_version_file(${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/FooConfigVersion.cmake
                                    VERSION 1.2.3
                                    COMPATIBILITY SameMajorVersion )
   install(FILES ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/FooConfig.cmake ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/FooConfigVersion.cmake
           DESTINATION ${LIB_INSTALL_DIR}/Foo/cmake )
.fi




With a FooConfig.cmake.in:


.nf
   set(FOO_VERSION x.y.z)
   ...
   @PACKAGE_INIT@
   ...
   set_and_check(FOO_INCLUDE_DIR "@PACKAGE_INCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR@")
   set_and_check(FOO_SYSCONFIG_DIR "@PACKAGE_SYSCONFIG_INSTALL_DIR@")
.fi




.nf
   check_required_components(Foo)
.fi

.TP
.B CMakeParseArguments
.nf
 
.fi

CMAKE_PARSE_ARGUMENTS(<prefix> <options> <one_value_keywords> <multi_value_keywords> args...)


CMAKE_PARSE_ARGUMENTS() is intended to be used in macros or functions for parsing the arguments given to that macro or function. It processes the arguments and defines a set of variables which hold the values of the respective options.


The <options> argument contains all options for the respective macro, i.e. keywords which can be used when calling the macro without any value following, like e.g. the OPTIONAL keyword of the install() command.


The <one_value_keywords> argument contains all keywords for this macro which are followed by one value, like e.g. DESTINATION keyword of the install() command.


The <multi_value_keywords> argument contains all keywords for this macro which can be followed by more than one value, like e.g. the TARGETS or FILES keywords of the install() command.


When done, CMAKE_PARSE_ARGUMENTS() will have defined for each of the keywords listed in <options>, <one_value_keywords> and <multi_value_keywords> a variable composed of the given <prefix> followed by "_" and the name of the respective keyword. These variables will then hold the respective value from the argument list. For the <options> keywords this will be TRUE or FALSE.


All remaining arguments are collected in a variable <prefix>_UNPARSED_ARGUMENTS, this can be checked afterwards to see whether your macro was called with unrecognized parameters.


As an example here a my_install() macro, which takes similar arguments as the real install() command:


.nf
   function(MY_INSTALL)
     set(options OPTIONAL FAST)
     set(oneValueArgs DESTINATION RENAME)
     set(multiValueArgs TARGETS CONFIGURATIONS)
     cmake_parse_arguments(MY_INSTALL "${options}" "${oneValueArgs}" "${multiValueArgs}" ${ARGN} )
     ...
.fi




Assume my_install() has been called like this:


.nf
   my_install(TARGETS foo bar DESTINATION bin OPTIONAL blub)
.fi




After the cmake_parse_arguments() call the macro will have set the following variables:


.nf
   MY_INSTALL_OPTIONAL = TRUE
   MY_INSTALL_FAST = FALSE (this option was not used when calling my_install()
   MY_INSTALL_DESTINATION = "bin"
   MY_INSTALL_RENAME = "" (was not used)
   MY_INSTALL_TARGETS = "foo;bar"
   MY_INSTALL_CONFIGURATIONS = "" (was not used)
   MY_INSTALL_UNPARSED_ARGUMENTS = "blub" (no value expected after "OPTIONAL"
.fi




You can the continue and process these variables.


Keywords terminate lists of values, e.g. if directly after a one_value_keyword another recognized keyword follows, this is interpreted as the beginning of the new option. E.g. my_install(TARGETS foo DESTINATION OPTIONAL) would result in MY_INSTALL_DESTINATION set to "OPTIONAL", but MY_INSTALL_DESTINATION would be empty and MY_INSTALL_OPTIONAL would be set to TRUE therefor.

.TP
.B CMakePrintSystemInformation
print system information

This file can be used for diagnostic purposes just include it in a project to see various internal CMake variables.

.TP
.B CMakePushCheckState
.nf
 
.fi

This module defines two macros: CMAKE_PUSH_CHECK_STATE() and CMAKE_POP_CHECK_STATE() These two macros can be used to save and restore the state of the variables CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS, CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS, CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES and CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES used by the various Check\-files coming with CMake, like e.g. check_function_exists() etc. The variable contents are pushed on a stack, pushing multiple times is supported. This is useful e.g. when executing such tests in a Find\-module, where they have to be set, but after the Find\-module has been executed they should have the same value as they had before.


Usage:


.nf
   cmake_push_check_state()
   set(CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS ${CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS} \-DSOME_MORE_DEF)
   check_function_exists(...)
   cmake_pop_check_state()
.fi

.TP
.B CMakeVerifyManifest
.nf
 
.fi

CMakeVerifyManifest.cmake


This script is used to verify that embeded manifests and side by side manifests for a project match.  To run this script, cd to a directory and run the script with cmake \-P. On the command line you can pass in versions that are OK even if not found in the .manifest files. For example, cmake \-Dallow_versions=8.0.50608.0 \-PCmakeVerifyManifest.cmake could be used to allow an embeded manifest of 8.0.50608.0 to be used in a project even if that version was not found in the .manifest file.

.TP
.B CPack
Build binary and source package installers.

The CPack module generates binary and source installers in a variety of formats using the cpack program. Inclusion of the CPack module adds two new targets to the resulting makefiles, package and package_source, which build the binary and source installers, respectively. The generated binary installers contain everything installed via CMake's INSTALL command (and the deprecated INSTALL_FILES, INSTALL_PROGRAMS, and INSTALL_TARGETS commands).


For certain kinds of binary installers (including the graphical installers on Mac OS X and Windows), CPack generates installers that allow users to select individual application components to install. See CPackComponent module for that.


The CPACK_GENERATOR variable has different meanings in different contexts. In your CMakeLists.txt file, CPACK_GENERATOR is a *list of generators*: when run with no other arguments, CPack will iterate over that list and produce one package for each generator. In a CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE, though, CPACK_GENERATOR is a *string naming a single generator*. If you need per\-cpack\- generator logic to control *other* cpack settings, then you need a CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE.


The CMake source tree itself contains a CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE. See the top level file CMakeCPackOptions.cmake.in for an example.


If set, the CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE is included automatically on a per\-generator basis. It only need contain overrides.


Here's how it works:


.nf
  \- cpack runs
  \- it includes CPackConfig.cmake
  \- it iterates over the generators listed in that file's
    CPACK_GENERATOR list variable (unless told to use just a
    specific one via \-G on the command line...)
.fi




.nf
  \- foreach generator, it then
    \- sets CPACK_GENERATOR to the one currently being iterated
    \- includes the CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE
    \- produces the package for that generator
.fi




This is the key: For each generator listed in CPACK_GENERATOR in CPackConfig.cmake, cpack will *reset* CPACK_GENERATOR internally to *the one currently being used* and then include the CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE.


Before including this CPack module in your CMakeLists.txt file, there are a variety of variables that can be set to customize the resulting installers. The most commonly\-used variables are:


.nf
  CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME \- The name of the package (or application). If
  not specified, defaults to the project name.
.fi




.nf
  CPACK_PACKAGE_VENDOR \- The name of the package vendor. (e.g.,
  "Kitware").
.fi




.nf
  CPACK_PACKAGE_DIRECTORY \- The directory in which CPack is doing its
  packaging. If it is not set then this will default (internally) to the
  build dir. This variable may be defined in CPack config file or from
  the cpack command line option "\-B". If set the command line option
  override the value found in the config file.
.fi

.nf
  CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_SUMMARY \- Short description of the
  project (only a few words).
.fi




.nf
  CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME \- The name of the package file to generate,
  not including the extension. For example, cmake\-2.6.1\-Linux\-i686.
  The default value is
.fi




.nf
  ${CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME}\-${CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION}\-${CPACK_SYSTEM_NAME}.
.fi




.nf
  CPACK_PACKAGE_INSTALL_DIRECTORY \- Installation directory on the
  target system. This may be used by some CPack generators
  like NSIS to create an installation directory e.g., "CMake 2.5"
  below the installation prefix. All installed element will be
  put inside this directory.
.fi




.nf
   CPACK_PACKAGE_ICON \- A branding image that will be displayed inside
   the installer (used by GUI installers).
.fi




.nf
  CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE \- CPack\-time project CPack configuration

  generator after CPack has set CPACK_GENERATOR to the actual generator
  being used. It allows per\-generator setting of CPACK_* variables at
  cpack time.
.fi




.nf
  CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE \- License to be embedded in the installer. It
  will typically be displayed to the user by the produced installer
  (often with an explicit "Accept" button, for graphical installers)
  prior to installation. This license file is NOT added to installed
  file but is used by some CPack generators like NSIS. If you want
  to install a license file (may be the same as this one)
  along with your project you must add an appropriate CMake INSTALL
  command in your CMakeLists.txt.
.fi




.nf

  may be asked to do component packaging by setting
  CPACK_<GENNAME>_COMPONENT_INSTALL to 1/TRUE.
.fi




.nf
  CPACK_GENERATOR \- List of CPack generators to use. If not
  specified, CPack will create a set of options CPACK_BINARY_<GENNAME> (e.g.,

  for binary installers. Defaults to CPackConfig.cmake.
.fi




.nf
  CPACK_PACKAGE_EXECUTABLES \- Lists each of the executables and associated
  text label to be used to create Start Menu shortcuts. For example,
  setting this to the list ccmake;CMake will
  create a shortcut named "CMake" that will execute the installed
  executable ccmake. Not all CPack generators use it (at least NSIS and
  OSXX11 do).
.fi




.nf
  CPACK_STRIP_FILES \- List of files to be stripped. Starting with
  CMake 2.6.0 CPACK_STRIP_FILES will be a boolean variable which
  enables stripping of all files (a list of files evaluates to TRUE
  in CMake, so this change is compatible).

  stripping of all files (a list of files evaluates to TRUE in CMake,
  so this change is compatible).
.fi




.nf
  CPACK_SOURCE_GENERATOR \- List of generators used for the source
  packages. As with CPACK_GENERATOR, if this is not specified then
  CPack will create a set of options (e.g., CPACK_SOURCE_ZIP)
  allowing users to select which packages will be generated.
.fi




.nf
  CPACK_SOURCE_OUTPUT_CONFIG_FILE \- The name of the CPack source
  configuration file. This file is the CPack configuration generated by the

  CPACK_CMAKE_GENERATOR \- What CMake generator should be used if the
  project is CMake project. Defaults to the value of CMAKE_GENERATOR
  few users will want to change this setting.
.fi




.nf
  CPACK_INSTALL_CMAKE_PROJECTS \- List of four values that specify
  what project to install. The four values are: Build directory,

.TP
.B CPackComponent
Build binary and source package installers




The CPackComponent module is the module which handles the component part of CPack. See CPack module for general information about CPack.


For certain kinds of binary installers (including the graphical installers on Mac OS X and Windows), CPack generates installers that allow users to select individual application components to install. The contents of each of the components are identified by the COMPONENT argument of CMake's INSTALL command. These components can be annotated with user\-friendly names and descriptions, inter\-component dependencies, etc., and grouped in various ways to customize the resulting installer. See the cpack_add_* commands, described below, for more information about component\-specific installations.


Component\-specific installation allows users to select specific sets of components to install during the install process. Installation components are identified by the COMPONENT argument of CMake's INSTALL commands, and should be further described by the following CPack commands:


.nf
  CPACK_COMPONENTS_ALL \- The list of component to install.
.fi




The default value of this variable is computed by CPack and contains all components defined by the project. The user may set it to only include the specified components.


.nf
  CPACK_<GENNAME>_COMPONENT_INSTALL \- Enable/Disable component install for
  CPack generator <GENNAME>.
.fi




Each CPack Generator (RPM, DEB, ARCHIVE, NSIS, DMG, etc...) has a legacy default behavior. e.g. RPM builds monolithic whereas NSIS builds component. One can change the default behavior by setting this variable to 0/1 or OFF/ON.


.nf
  CPACK_COMPONENTS_GROUPING \- Specify how components are grouped for multi\-package
  component\-aware CPack generators.
.fi




Some generators like RPM or ARCHIVE family (TGZ, ZIP, ...) generates several packages files when asked for component packaging. They group the component differently depending on the value of this variable:


.nf
  \- ONE_PER_GROUP (default): creates one package file per component group
  \- ALL_COMPONENTS_IN_ONE : creates a single package with all (requested) component
  \- IGNORE : creates one package per component, i.e. IGNORE component group
.fi

One can specify different grouping for different CPack generator by using a CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE.


.nf
  CPACK_COMPONENT_<compName>_DISPLAY_NAME \- The name to be displayed for a component.
  CPACK_COMPONENT_<compName>_DESCRIPTION \- The description of a component.
  CPACK_COMPONENT_<compName>_GROUP \- The group of a component.
  CPACK_COMPONENT_<compName>_DEPENDS \- The dependencies (list of components)
  on which this component depends.
  CPACK_COMPONENT_<compName>_REQUIRED \- True is this component is required.
.fi

cpack_add_component \- Describes a CPack installation component named by the COMPONENT argument to a CMake INSTALL command.


.nf
  cpack_add_component(compname
                      [DISPLAY_NAME name]
                      [DESCRIPTION description]
                      [HIDDEN | REQUIRED | DISABLED ]
                      [GROUP group]
                      [DEPENDS comp1 comp2 ... ]
                      [INSTALL_TYPES type1 type2 ... ]
                      [DOWNLOADED]
                      [ARCHIVE_FILE filename])
.fi




The cmake_add_component command describes an installation component, which the user can opt to install or remove as part of the graphical installation process. compname is the name of the component, as provided to the COMPONENT argument of one or more CMake INSTALL commands.


DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the component, used in graphical installers to display the component name. This value can be any string.


DESCRIPTION is an extended description of the component, used in graphical installers to give the user additional information about the component. Descriptions can span multiple lines using "\\n" as the line separator. Typically, these descriptions should be no more than a few lines long.


HIDDEN indicates that this component will be hidden in the graphical installer, so that the user cannot directly change whether it is installed or not.


REQUIRED indicates that this component is required, and therefore will always be installed. It will be visible in the graphical installer, but it cannot be unselected. (Typically, required components are shown greyed out).


DISABLED indicates that this component should be disabled (unselected) by default. The user is free to select this component for installation, unless it is also HIDDEN.


DEPENDS lists the components on which this component depends. If this component is selected, then each of the components listed must also be selected. The dependency information is encoded within the installer itself, so that users cannot install inconsistent sets of components.


GROUP names the component group of which this component is a part. If not provided, the component will be a standalone component, not part of any component group. Component groups are described with the cpack_add_component_group command, detailed below.


INSTALL_TYPES lists the installation types of which this component is a part. When one of these installations types is selected, this component will automatically be selected. Installation types are described with the cpack_add_install_type command, detailed below.


DOWNLOADED indicates that this component should be downloaded on\-the\-fly by the installer, rather than packaged in with the installer itself. For more information, see the cpack_configure_downloads command.


ARCHIVE_FILE provides a name for the archive file created by CPack to be used for downloaded components. If not supplied, CPack will create a file with some name based on CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME and the name of the component. See cpack_configure_downloads for more information.


cpack_add_component_group \- Describes a group of related CPack installation components.


.nf
  cpack_add_component_group(groupname
                           [DISPLAY_NAME name]
                           [DESCRIPTION description]
                           [PARENT_GROUP parent]
                           [EXPANDED]
                           [BOLD_TITLE])
.fi




The cpack_add_component_group describes a group of installation components, which will be placed together within the listing of options. Typically, component groups allow the user to select/deselect all of the components within a single group via a single group\-level option. Use component groups to reduce the complexity of installers with many options. groupname is an arbitrary name used to identify the group in the GROUP argument of the cpack_add_component command, which is used to place a component in a group. The name of the group must not conflict with the name of any component.


DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the component group, used in graphical installers to display the component group name. This value can be any string.


DESCRIPTION is an extended description of the component group, used in graphical installers to give the user additional information about the components within that group. Descriptions can span multiple lines using "\\n" as the line separator. Typically, these descriptions should be no more than a few lines long.


PARENT_GROUP, if supplied, names the parent group of this group. Parent groups are used to establish a hierarchy of groups, providing an arbitrary hierarchy of groups.


EXPANDED indicates that, by default, the group should show up as "expanded", so that the user immediately sees all of the components within the group. Otherwise, the group will initially show up as a single entry.


BOLD_TITLE indicates that the group title should appear in bold, to call the user's attention to the group.


cpack_add_install_type \- Add a new installation type containing a set of predefined component selections to the graphical installer.


.nf
  cpack_add_install_type(typename
                         [DISPLAY_NAME name])
.fi




The cpack_add_install_type command identifies a set of preselected components that represents a common use case for an application. For example, a "Developer" install type might include an application along with its header and library files, while an "End user" install type might just include the application's executable. Each component identifies itself with one or more install types via the INSTALL_TYPES argument to cpack_add_component.


DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the install type, which will typically show up in a drop\-down box within a graphical installer. This value can be any string.


cpack_configure_downloads \- Configure CPack to download selected components on\-the\-fly as part of the installation process.


.nf
  cpack_configure_downloads(site
                            [UPLOAD_DIRECTORY dirname]
                            [ALL]
                            [ADD_REMOVE|NO_ADD_REMOVE])
.fi




The cpack_configure_downloads command configures installation\-time downloads of selected components. For each downloadable component, CPack will create an archive containing the contents of that component, which should be uploaded to the given site. When the user selects that component for installation, the installer will download and extract the component in place. This feature is useful for creating small installers that only download the requested components, saving bandwidth. Additionally, the installers are small enough that they will be installed as part of the normal installation process, and the "Change" button in Windows Add/Remove Programs control panel will allow one to add or remove parts of the application after the original installation. On Windows, the downloaded\-components functionality requires the ZipDLL plug\-in for NSIS, available at:


.nf
  http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ZipDLL_plug\-in
.fi




On Mac OS X, installers that download components on\-the\-fly can only be built and installed on system using Mac OS X 10.5 or later.


The site argument is a URL where the archives for downloadable components will reside, e.g., http://www.cmake.org/files/2.6.1/installer/ All of the archives produced by CPack should be uploaded to that location.


UPLOAD_DIRECTORY is the local directory where CPack will create the various archives for each of the components. The contents of this directory should be uploaded to a location accessible by the URL given in the site argument. If omitted, CPack will use the directory CPackUploads inside the CMake binary directory to store the generated archives.


The ALL flag indicates that all components be downloaded. Otherwise, only those components explicitly marked as DOWNLOADED or that have a specified ARCHIVE_FILE will be downloaded. Additionally, the ALL option implies ADD_REMOVE (unless NO_ADD_REMOVE is specified).


ADD_REMOVE indicates that CPack should install a copy of the installer that can be called from Windows' Add/Remove Programs dialog (via the "Modify" button) to change the set of installed components. NO_ADD_REMOVE turns off this behavior. This option is ignored on Mac OS X.

  that your installer will work on that version of Mac OS X, and
  don't mind missing extra features available in the installer
  shipping with later versions of Mac OS X.

.TP
.B CPackRPM
The builtin (binary) CPack RPM generator (Unix only)

CPackRPM may be used to create RPM package using CPack. CPackRPM is a CPack generator thus it uses the CPACK_XXX variables used by CPack : http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:CPackConfiguration


However CPackRPM has specific features which are controlled by the specifics CPACK_RPM_XXX variables. CPackRPM is a component aware generator so when CPACK_RPM_COMPONENT_INSTALL is ON some more CPACK_RPM_<ComponentName>_XXXX variables may be used in order to have component specific values. Note however that <componentName> refers to the **grouping name**. This may be either a component name or a component GROUP name. Usually those vars correspond to RPM spec file entities, one may find information about spec files here http://www.rpm.org/wiki/Docs. You'll find a detailed usage of CPackRPM on the wiki:


.nf
  http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:CPackPackageGenerators#RPM_.28Unix_Only.29
.fi

However as a handy reminder here comes the list of specific variables:


.nf
  CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_SUMMARY \- The RPM package summary.
     Mandatory : YES
     Default   : CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_SUMMARY
  CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_NAME \- The RPM package name.
     Mandatory : YES

     Default   : \-
     This may be set to "noarch" if you
     know you are building a noarch package.
  CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_RELEASE \- The RPM package release.
     Mandatory : YES
     Default   : 1
     This is the numbering of the RPM package
     itself, i.e. the version of the packaging and not the version of the
     content (see CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_VERSION). One may change the default
     value if the previous packaging was buggy and/or you want to put here
     a fancy Linux distro specific numbering.
  CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_LICENSE \- The RPM package license policy.
     Mandatory : YES
     Default   : "unknown"
  CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_GROUP \- The RPM package group.
     Mandatory : YES
     Default   : "unknown"
  CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_VENDOR \- The RPM package vendor.
     Mandatory : YES
     Default   : CPACK_PACKAGE_VENDOR if set or "unknown"
  CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_URL \- The projects URL.
     Mandatory : NO
     Default   : \-

     Mandatory : YES
     Default   : CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_FILE if set or "no package description available"
  CPACK_RPM_COMPRESSION_TYPE \- RPM compression type.
     Mandatory : NO
     Default   : \-
     May be used to override RPM compression type to be used
     to build the RPM. For example some Linux distribution now default
     to lzma or xz compression whereas older cannot use such RPM.
     Using this one can enforce compression type to be used.
     Possible value are: lzma, xz, bzip2 and gzip.
  CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_REQUIRES \- RPM spec requires field.
     Mandatory : NO
     Default   : \-
     May be used to set RPM dependencies (requires).
     Note that you must enclose the complete requires string between quotes,
     for example:
     set(CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_REQUIRES "python >= 2.5.0, cmake >= 2.8")
     The required package list of an RPM file could be printed with
     rpm \-qp \-\-requires file.rpm
  CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_SUGGESTS \- RPM spec suggest field.
     Mandatory : NO
     Default   : \-
     May be used to set weak RPM dependencies (suggests).
     Note that you must enclose the complete requires string between quotes.
  CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_PROVIDES \- RPM spec provides field.
     Mandatory : NO
     Default   : \-
     May be used to set RPM dependencies (provides).
     The provided package list of an RPM file could be printed with
     rpm \-qp \-\-provides file.rpm
  CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_OBSOLETES \- RPM spec obsoletes field.
     Mandatory : NO
     Default   : \-
     May be used to set RPM packages that are obsoleted by this one.
  CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_RELOCATABLE \- build a relocatable RPM.
     Mandatory : NO
     Default   : CPACK_PACKAGE_RELOCATABLE
     If this variable is set to TRUE or ON CPackRPM will try
     to build a relocatable RPM package. A relocatable RPM may
     be installed using rpm \-\-prefix or \-\-relocate in order to
     install it at an alternate place see rpm(8).
     Note that currently this may fail if CPACK_SET_DESTDIR is set to ON.
     If CPACK_SET_DESTDIR is set then you will get a warning message
     but if there is file installed with absolute path you'll get
     unexpected behavior.
  CPACK_RPM_SPEC_INSTALL_POST \- [deprecated].
     Mandatory : NO
     Default   : \-
     This way of specifying post\-install script is deprecated use
     CPACK_RPM_POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE
     May be used to set an RPM post\-install command inside the spec file.
     For example setting it to "/bin/true" may be used to prevent
     rpmbuild to strip binaries.
  CPACK_RPM_SPEC_MORE_DEFINE \- RPM extended spec definitions lines.
     Mandatory : NO
     Default   : \-
     May be used to add any %define lines to the generated spec file.
  CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_DEBUG \- Toggle CPackRPM debug output.
     Mandatory : NO
     Default   : \-
     May be set when invoking cpack in order to trace debug information
     during CPack RPM run. For example you may launch CPack like this
     cpack \-D CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_DEBUG=1 \-G RPM
  CPACK_RPM_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE \- A user provided spec file.
     Mandatory : NO
     Default   : \-
     May be set by the user in order to specify a USER binary spec file
     to be used by CPackRPM instead of generating the file.
     The specified file will be processed by configure_file( @ONLY).
  CPACK_RPM_GENERATE_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE_TEMPLATE \- Spec file template.
     Mandatory : NO
     Default   : \-
     If set CPack will generate a template for USER specified binary
     spec file and stop with an error. For example launch CPack like this
     cpack \-D CPACK_RPM_GENERATE_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE_TEMPLATE=1 \-G RPM
     The user may then use this file in order to hand\-craft is own
     binary spec file which may be used with CPACK_RPM_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE.
  CPACK_RPM_PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE
  CPACK_RPM_PRE_UNINSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE
     Mandatory : NO
     Default   : \-
     May be used to embed a pre (un)installation script in the spec file.
     The refered script file(s) will be read and directly
     put after the %pre or %preun section
     If CPACK_RPM_COMPONENT_INSTALL is set to ON the (un)install script for
     each component can be overridden with
     CPACK_RPM_<COMPONENT>_PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE and
     CPACK_RPM_<COMPONENT>_PRE_UNINSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE
     One may verify which scriptlet has been included with
      rpm \-qp \-\-scripts  package.rpm
  CPACK_RPM_POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE
  CPACK_RPM_POST_UNINSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE
     Mandatory : NO
     Default   : \-
     May be used to embed a post (un)installation script in the spec file.
     The refered script file(s) will be read and directly
     put after the %post or %postun section
     If CPACK_RPM_COMPONENT_INSTALL is set to ON the (un)install script for
     each component can be overridden with
     CPACK_RPM_<COMPONENT>_POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE and
     CPACK_RPM_<COMPONENT>_POST_UNINSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE
     One may verify which scriptlet has been included with
      rpm \-qp \-\-scripts  package.rpm
  CPACK_RPM_USER_FILELIST
  CPACK_RPM_<COMPONENT>_USER_FILELIST
     Mandatory : NO
     Default   : \-
     May be used to explicitly specify %(<directive>) file line
     in the spec file. Like %config(noreplace) or any other directive
     that be found in the %files section. Since CPackRPM is generating
     the list of files (and directories) the user specified files of
     the CPACK_RPM_<COMPONENT>_USER_FILELIST list will be removed from the generated list.
  CPACK_RPM_CHANGELOG_FILE \- RPM changelog file.
     Mandatory : NO
     Default   : \-
     May be used to embed a changelog in the spec file.
     The refered file will be read and directly put after the %changelog
     section.

.TP
.B CPackWIX
CPack WiX generator specific options




The following variables are specific to the installers built on Windows using WiX.


.nf
  CPACK_WIX_UPGRADE_GUID \- Upgrade GUID (Product/@UpgradeCode)
.fi




Will be automatically generated unless explicitly provided.


It should be explicitly set to a constant generated gloabally unique identifier (GUID) to allow your installers to replace existing installations that use the same GUID.


You may for example explicitly set this variable in your CMakeLists.txt to the value that has been generated per default. You should not use GUIDs that you did not generate yourself or which may belong to other projects.


A GUID shall have the following fixed length syntax: XXXXXXXX\-XXXX\-XXXX\-XXXX\-XXXXXXXXXXXX


.nf
  (each X represents an uppercase hexadecimal digit)
  CPACK_WIX_PRODUCT_GUID \- Product GUID (Product/@Id)
.fi




Will be automatically generated unless explicitly provided.


If explicitly provided this will set the Product Id of your installer.


The installer will abort if it detects a pre\-existing installation that uses the same GUID.


The GUID shall use the syntax described for CPACK_WIX_UPGRADE_GUID.


.nf
  CPACK_WIX_LICENSE_RTF \- RTF License File
.fi




If CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE has an .rtf extension it is used as\-is.


If CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE has an .txt extension it is implicitly converted to RTF by the WiX Generator.


With CPACK_WIX_LICENSE_RTF you can override the license file used by the WiX Generator in case CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE is in an unsupported format or the .txt \-> .rtf conversion does not work as expected.





CPACK_WIX_PRODUCT_ICON \- The Icon shown next to the program name in Add/Remove programs.


If set, this icon is used in place of the default icon.





CPACK_WIX_UI_BANNER \- The bitmap will appear at the top of all installer pages other than the welcome and completion dialogs.


If set, this image will replace the default banner image.


This image must be 493 by 58 pixels.





CPACK_WIX_UI_DIALOG \- Background bitmap used on the welcome and completion dialogs.


If this variable is set, the installer will replace the default dialog image.


This image must be 493 by 312 pixels.


.TP
.B CTest
Configure a project for testing with CTest/CDash

Include this module in the top CMakeLists.txt file of a project to enable testing with CTest and dashboard submissions to CDash:


.nf
   project(MyProject)
   ...
   include(CTest)
.fi

The module automatically creates a BUILD_TESTING option that selects whether to enable testing support (ON by default).  After including the module, use code like


.nf
   if(BUILD_TESTING)
     # ... CMake code to create tests ...
   endif()
.fi

to creating tests when testing is enabled.


To enable submissions to a CDash server, create a CTestConfig.cmake file at the top of the project with content such as


.nf
   set(CTEST_PROJECT_NAME "MyProject")
   set(CTEST_NIGHTLY_START_TIME "01:00:00 UTC")
   set(CTEST_DROP_METHOD "http")
   set(CTEST_DROP_SITE "my.cdash.org")
   set(CTEST_DROP_LOCATION "/submit.php?project=MyProject")
   set(CTEST_DROP_SITE_CDASH TRUE)
.fi

(the CDash server can provide the file to a project administrator who configures 'MyProject'). Settings in the config file are shared by both this CTest module and the CTest command\-line tool's dashboard script mode (ctest \-S).


While building a project for submission to CDash, CTest scans the build output for errors and warnings and reports them with surrounding context from the build log.  This generic approach works for all build tools, but does not give details about the command invocation that produced a given problem.  One may get more detailed reports by adding


.nf
   set(CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS 1)
.fi

to the CTestConfig.cmake file.  When this option is enabled, the CTest module tells CMake's Makefile generators to invoke every command in the generated build system through a CTest launcher program.  (Currently the CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS option is ignored on non\-Makefile generators.)  During a manual build each launcher transparently runs the command it wraps.  During a CTest\-driven build for submission to CDash each launcher reports detailed information when its command fails or warns. (Setting CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS in CTestConfig.cmake is convenient, but also adds the launcher overhead even for manual builds.  One may instead set it in a CTest dashboard script and add it to the CMake cache for the build tree.)

.TP
.B CTestScriptMode
.nf
 
.fi

This file is read by ctest in script mode (\-S)

.TP
.B CTestUseLaunchers
Set the RULE_LAUNCH_* global properties when CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS is on.

CTestUseLaunchers is automatically included when you include(CTest). However, it is split out into its own module file so projects can use the CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS functionality independently.


To use launchers, set CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS to ON in a ctest \-S dashboard script, and then also set it in the cache of the configured project. Both cmake and ctest need to know the value of it for the launchers to work properly. CMake needs to know in order to generate proper build rules, and ctest, in order to produce the proper error and warning analysis.


For convenience, you may set the ENV variable CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS_DEFAULT in your ctest \-S script, too. Then, as long as your CMakeLists uses include(CTest) or include(CTestUseLaunchers), it will use the value of the ENV variable to initialize a CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS cache variable. This cache variable initialization only occurs if CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS is not already defined.

CHECK_CXX_SYMBOL_EXISTS(<symbol> <files> <variable>)


Check that the <symbol> is available after including given header <files> and store the result in a <variable>.  Specify the list of files in one argument as a semicolon\-separated list. CHECK_CXX_SYMBOL_EXISTS() can be used to check in C++ files, as opposed to CHECK_SYMBOL_EXISTS(), which works only for C.


If the header files define the symbol as a macro it is considered available and assumed to work.  If the header files declare the symbol as a function or variable then the symbol must also be available for linking.  If the symbol is a type or enum value it will not be recognized (consider using CheckTypeSize or CheckCSourceCompiles).

where <lang> is a language that may be passed to enable_language() such as "Fortran".  If CMAKE_<lang>_COMPILER is already defined the check does nothing.  Otherwise it tries enabling the language in a test project.  The result is cached in CMAKE_<lang>_COMPILER as the compiler that was found, or NOTFOUND if the language cannot be enabled.


Example:


.nf
  check_language(Fortran)
  if(CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER)
    enable_language(Fortran)
  else()
    message(STATUS "No Fortran support")
  endif()
.fi

.TP
.B CheckLibraryExists
Check if the function exists.

CHECK_LIBRARY_EXISTS (LIBRARY FUNCTION LOCATION VARIABLE)


.nf
  LIBRARY  \- the name of the library you are looking for
  FUNCTION \- the name of the function
  LOCATION \- location where the library should be found
  VARIABLE \- variable to store the result
.fi




The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify the way the check is run:


.nf
  CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line flags
  CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define (\-DFOO=bar)
  CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to link
.fi

.TP
.B CheckPrototypeDefinition
Check if the protoype we expect is correct.

  FUNCTION \- The name of the function (used to check if prototype exists)
  PROTOTYPE\- The prototype to check.
  RETURN \- The return value of the function.
  HEADER \- The header files required.
  VARIABLE \- The variable to store the result.
.fi

Example:


.nf
  check_prototype_definition(getpwent_r
   "struct passwd *getpwent_r(struct passwd *src, char *buf, int buflen)"
   "NULL"
   "unistd.h;pwd.h"
   SOLARIS_GETPWENT_R)
.fi

The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify the way the check is run:


.nf
  CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line flags
  CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define (\-DFOO=bar)
  CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include directories
  CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to link

CHECK_STRUCT_HAS_MEMBER (STRUCT MEMBER HEADER VARIABLE)


.nf
  STRUCT \- the name of the struct or class you are interested in
  MEMBER \- the member which existence you want to check
  HEADER \- the header(s) where the prototype should be declared
  VARIABLE \- variable to store the result
.fi

  CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define (\-DFOO=bar)
  CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include directories
.fi




Example: CHECK_STRUCT_HAS_MEMBER("struct timeval" tv_sec sys/select.h HAVE_TIMEVAL_TV_SEC)

.TP
.B CheckSymbolExists
Check if a symbol exists as a function, variable, or macro

CHECK_SYMBOL_EXISTS(<symbol> <files> <variable>)


Check that the <symbol> is available after including given header <files> and store the result in a <variable>.  Specify the list of files in one argument as a semicolon\-separated list.


If the header files define the symbol as a macro it is considered available and assumed to work.  If the header files declare the symbol as a function or variable then the symbol must also be available for linking.  If the symbol is a type or enum value it will not be recognized (consider using CheckTypeSize or CheckCSourceCompiles). If the check needs to be done in C++, consider using CHECK_CXX_SYMBOL_EXISTS(), which does the same as CHECK_SYMBOL_EXISTS(), but in C++.


The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify the way the check is run:


.nf
  CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line flags
  CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define (\-DFOO=bar)
  CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include directories
  CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to link
.fi

.TP
.B CheckTypeSize
Check sizeof a type

.nf
  CHECK_TYPE_SIZE(TYPE VARIABLE [BUILTIN_TYPES_ONLY])
.fi

Check if the type exists and determine its size. On return, "HAVE_${VARIABLE}" holds the existence of the type, and "${VARIABLE}" holds one of the following:


.nf
   <size> = type has non\-zero size <size>
   "0"    = type has arch\-dependent size (see below)
   ""     = type does not exist
.fi

Furthermore, the variable "${VARIABLE}_CODE" holds C preprocessor code to define the macro "${VARIABLE}" to the size of the type, or leave the macro undefined if the type does not exist.


The variable "${VARIABLE}" may be "0" when CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES has multiple architectures for building OS X universal binaries. This indicates that the type size varies across architectures. In this case "${VARIABLE}_CODE" contains C preprocessor tests mapping from each architecture macro to the corresponding type size. The list of architecture macros is stored in "${VARIABLE}_KEYS", and the value for each key is stored in "${VARIABLE}\-${KEY}".


If the BUILTIN_TYPES_ONLY option is not given, the macro checks for headers <sys/types.h>, <stdint.h>, and <stddef.h>, and saves results in HAVE_SYS_TYPES_H, HAVE_STDINT_H, and HAVE_STDDEF_H.  The type size check automatically includes the available headers, thus supporting checks of types defined in the headers.


Despite the name of the macro you may use it to check the size of more complex expressions, too. To check e.g. for the size of a struct member you can do something like this:


.nf
  check_type_size("((struct something*)0)\->member" SIZEOF_MEMBER)
.fi




The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify the way the check is run:


.nf
  CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line flags
  CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define (\-DFOO=bar)
  CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include directories
  CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to link
  CMAKE_EXTRA_INCLUDE_FILES = list of extra headers to include
.fi

.TP
.B CheckVariableExists
Check if the variable exists.

.nf
  CHECK_VARIABLE_EXISTS(VAR VARIABLE)

.B Dart
Configure a project for testing with CTest or old Dart Tcl Client

This file is the backwards\-compatibility version of the CTest module. It supports using the old Dart 1 Tcl client for driving dashboard submissions as well as testing with CTest.  This module should be included in the CMakeLists.txt file at the top of a project.  Typical usage:


.nf
  include(Dart)
  if(BUILD_TESTING)
    # ... testing related CMake code ...
  endif()
.fi

The BUILD_TESTING option is created by the Dart module to determine whether testing support should be enabled.  The default is ON.

.TP
.B DeployQt4
Functions to help assemble a standalone Qt4 executable.

A collection of CMake utility functions useful for deploying Qt4 executables.


The following functions are provided by this module:


.nf
   write_qt4_conf
   resolve_qt4_paths
   fixup_qt4_executable
   install_qt4_plugin_path
   install_qt4_plugin
   install_qt4_executable
.fi

Requires CMake 2.6 or greater because it uses function and PARENT_SCOPE. Also depends on BundleUtilities.cmake.


.nf
  WRITE_QT4_CONF(<qt_conf_dir> <qt_conf_contents>)
.fi

Writes a qt.conf file with the <qt_conf_contents> into <qt_conf_dir>.


.nf
  RESOLVE_QT4_PATHS(<paths_var> [<executable_path>])
.fi

Loop through <paths_var> list and if any don't exist resolve them relative to the <executable_path> (if supplied) or the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.


.nf
  FIXUP_QT4_EXECUTABLE(<executable> [<qtplugins> <libs> <dirs> <plugins_dir> <request_qt_conf>])
.fi

Copies Qt plugins, writes a Qt configuration file (if needed) and fixes up a Qt4 executable using BundleUtilities so it is standalone and can be drag\-and\-drop copied to another machine as long as all of the system libraries are compatible.


<executable> should point to the executable to be fixed\-up.


<qtplugins> should contain a list of the names or paths of any Qt plugins to be installed.


<libs> will be passed to BundleUtilities and should be a list of any already installed plugins, libraries or executables to also be fixed\-up.


<dirs> will be passed to BundleUtilities and should contain and directories to be searched to find library dependencies.


<plugins_dir> allows an custom plugins directory to be used.


<request_qt_conf> will force a qt.conf file to be written even if not needed.


.nf
  INSTALL_QT4_PLUGIN_PATH(plugin executable copy installed_plugin_path_var <plugins_dir> <component> <configurations>)
.fi

Install (or copy) a resolved <plugin> to the default plugins directory (or <plugins_dir>) relative to <executable> and store the result in <installed_plugin_path_var>.


If <copy> is set to TRUE then the plugins will be copied rather than installed. This is to allow this module to be used at CMake time rather than install time.


If <component> is set then anything installed will use this COMPONENT.


.nf
  INSTALL_QT4_PLUGIN(plugin executable copy installed_plugin_path_var <plugins_dir> <component>)
.fi

Install (or copy) an unresolved <plugin> to the default plugins directory (or <plugins_dir>) relative to <executable> and store the result in <installed_plugin_path_var>. See documentation of INSTALL_QT4_PLUGIN_PATH.


.nf
  INSTALL_QT4_EXECUTABLE(<executable> [<qtplugins> <libs> <dirs> <plugins_dir> <request_qt_conf> <component>])
.fi

Installs Qt plugins, writes a Qt configuration file (if needed) and fixes up a Qt4 executable using BundleUtilities so it is standalone and can be drag\-and\-drop copied to another machine as long as all of the system libraries are compatible. The executable will be fixed\-up at install time. <component> is the COMPONENT used for bundle fixup and plugin installation. See documentation of FIXUP_QT4_BUNDLE.

.TP
.B ExternalData
Manage data files stored outside source tree

Use this module to unambiguously reference data files stored outside the source tree and fetch them at build time from arbitrary local and remote content\-addressed locations.  Functions provided by this module recognize arguments with the syntax "DATA{<name>}" as references to external data, replace them with full paths to local copies of those data, and create build rules to fetch and update the local copies.


The DATA{} syntax is literal and the <name> is a full or relative path within the source tree.  The source tree must contain either a real data file at <name> or a "content link" at <name><ext> containing a hash of the real file using a hash algorithm corresponding to <ext>.  For example, the argument "DATA{img.png}" may be satisfied by either a real "img.png" file in the current source directory or a "img.png.md5" file containing its MD5 sum.


The 'ExternalData_Expand_Arguments' function evaluates DATA{} references in its arguments and constructs a new list of arguments:


.nf
  ExternalData_Expand_Arguments(
    <target>   # Name of data management target
    <outVar>   # Output variable
    [args...]  # Input arguments, DATA{} allowed
    )
.fi

It replaces each DATA{} reference in an argument with the full path of a real data file on disk that will exist after the <target> builds.


The 'ExternalData_Add_Test' function wraps around the CMake add_test() command but supports DATA{} references in its arguments:


.nf
  ExternalData_Add_Test(
    <target>   # Name of data management target
    ...        # Arguments of add_test(), DATA{} allowed
    )
.fi

It passes its arguments through ExternalData_Expand_Arguments and then invokes add_test() using the results.


The 'ExternalData_Add_Target' function creates a custom target to manage local instances of data files stored externally:


.nf
  ExternalData_Add_Target(
    <target>   # Name of data management target
    )
.fi

It creates custom commands in the target as necessary to make data files available for each DATA{} reference previously evaluated by other functions provided by this module.  A list of URL templates must be provided in the variable ExternalData_URL_TEMPLATES using the placeholders "%(algo)" and "%(hash)" in each template.  Data fetch rules try each URL template in order by substituting the hash algorithm name for "%(algo)" and the hash value for "%(hash)".


The following hash algorithms are supported:


.nf
    %(algo)     <ext>     Description
    \-\-\-\-\-\-\-     \-\-\-\-\-     \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
    MD5         .md5      Message\-Digest Algorithm 5, RFC 1321
    SHA1        .sha1     US Secure Hash Algorithm 1, RFC 3174
    SHA224      .sha224   US Secure Hash Algorithms, RFC 4634
    SHA256      .sha256   US Secure Hash Algorithms, RFC 4634
    SHA384      .sha384   US Secure Hash Algorithms, RFC 4634
    SHA512      .sha512   US Secure Hash Algorithms, RFC 4634
.fi

Note that the hashes are used only for unique data identification and download verification.  This is not security software.


Example usage:


.nf
   include(ExternalData)
   set(ExternalData_URL_TEMPLATES "file:///local/%(algo)/%(hash)"
                                  "http://data.org/%(algo)/%(hash)")
   ExternalData_Add_Test(MyData
     NAME MyTest
     COMMAND MyExe DATA{MyInput.png}
     )
   ExternalData_Add_Target(MyData)
.fi

When test "MyTest" runs the "DATA{MyInput.png}" argument will be replaced by the full path to a real instance of the data file "MyInput.png" on disk.  If the source tree contains a content link such as "MyInput.png.md5" then the "MyData" target creates a real "MyInput.png" in the build tree.


The DATA{} syntax can be told to fetch a file series using the form "DATA{<name>,:}", where the ":" is literal.  If the source tree contains a group of files or content links named like a series then a reference to one member adds rules to fetch all of them.  Although all members of a series are fetched, only the file originally named by the DATA{} argument is substituted for it.  The default configuration recognizes file series names ending with "#.ext", "_#.ext", ".#.ext", or "\-#.ext" where "#" is a sequence of decimal digits and ".ext" is any single extension.  Configure it with a regex that parses <number> and <suffix> parts from the end of <name>:


.nf
  ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE = regex of the form (<number>)(<suffix>)$
.fi

For more complicated cases set:


.nf
  ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE = regex with at least two () groups
  ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE_PREFIX = <prefix> regex group number, if any
  ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE_NUMBER = <number> regex group number
  ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE_SUFFIX = <suffix> regex group number
.fi

Configure series number matching with a regex that matches the <number> part of series members named <prefix><number><suffix>:


.nf
  ExternalData_SERIES_MATCH = regex matching <number> in all series members
.fi

Note that the <suffix> of a series does not include a hash\-algorithm extension.


The DATA{} syntax can alternatively match files associated with the named file and contained in the same directory.  Associated files may be specified by options using the syntax DATA{<name>,<opt1>,<opt2>,...}.  Each option may specify one file by name or specify a regular expression to match file names using the syntax REGEX:<regex>.  For example, the arguments


.nf
   DATA{MyData/MyInput.mhd,MyInput.img}                   # File pair
   DATA{MyData/MyFrames00.png,REGEX:MyFrames[0\-9]+\\\\.png} # Series
.fi

will pass MyInput.mha and MyFrames00.png on the command line but ensure that the associated files are present next to them.


The DATA{} syntax may reference a directory using a trailing slash and a list of associated files.  The form DATA{<name>/,<opt1>,<opt2>,...} adds rules to fetch any files in the directory that match one of the associated file options.  For example, the argument DATA{MyDataDir/,REGEX:.*} will pass the full path to a MyDataDir directory on the command line and ensure that the directory contains files corresponding to every file or content link in the MyDataDir source directory.


The variable ExternalData_LINK_CONTENT may be set to the name of a supported hash algorithm to enable automatic conversion of real data files referenced by the DATA{} syntax into content links.  For each such <file> a content link named "<file><ext>" is created.  The original file is renamed to the form ".ExternalData_<algo>_<hash>" to stage it for future transmission to one of the locations in the list of URL templates (by means outside the scope of this module).  The data fetch rule created for the content link will use the staged object if it cannot be found using any URL template.


The variable ExternalData_OBJECT_STORES may be set to a list of local directories that store objects using the layout <dir>/%(algo)/%(hash). These directories will be searched first for a needed object.  If the object is not available in any store then it will be fetched remotely using the URL templates and added to the first local store listed.  If no stores are specified the default is a location inside the build tree.


The variable ExternalData_SOURCE_ROOT may be set to the highest source directory containing any path named by a DATA{} reference.  The default is CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR.  ExternalData_SOURCE_ROOT and CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR must refer to directories within a single source distribution (e.g. they come together in one tarball).


The variable ExternalData_BINARY_ROOT may be set to the directory to hold the real data files named by expanded DATA{} references.  The default is CMAKE_BINARY_DIR.  The directory layout will mirror that of content links under ExternalData_SOURCE_ROOT.


Variables ExternalData_TIMEOUT_INACTIVITY and ExternalData_TIMEOUT_ABSOLUTE set the download inactivity and absolute timeouts, in seconds.  The defaults are 60 seconds and 300 seconds, respectively.  Set either timeout to 0 seconds to disable enforcement.

.B ExternalProject

The 'ExternalProject_Add' function creates a custom target to drive download, update/patch, configure, build, install and test steps of an external project:


.nf

    [STEP_TARGETS st1 st2 ...]  # Generate custom targets for these steps
    )
.fi

The *_DIR options specify directories for the project, with default directories computed as follows. If the PREFIX option is given to ExternalProject_Add() or the EP_PREFIX directory property is set, then an external project is built and installed under the specified prefix:


.nf
   TMP_DIR      = <prefix>/tmp
   STAMP_DIR    = <prefix>/src/<name>\-stamp
   DOWNLOAD_DIR = <prefix>/src
   SOURCE_DIR   = <prefix>/src/<name>
   BINARY_DIR   = <prefix>/src/<name>\-build
   INSTALL_DIR  = <prefix>
.fi

Otherwise, if the EP_BASE directory property is set then components of an external project are stored under the specified base:


.nf
   TMP_DIR      = <base>/tmp/<name>
   STAMP_DIR    = <base>/Stamp/<name>
   DOWNLOAD_DIR = <base>/Download/<name>
   SOURCE_DIR   = <base>/Source/<name>
   BINARY_DIR   = <base>/Build/<name>
   INSTALL_DIR  = <base>/Install/<name>
.fi

If no PREFIX, EP_PREFIX, or EP_BASE is specified then the default is to set PREFIX to "<name>\-prefix". Relative paths are interpreted with respect to the build directory corresponding to the source directory in which ExternalProject_Add is invoked.


If SOURCE_DIR is explicitly set to an existing directory the project will be built from it. Otherwise a download step must be specified using one of the DOWNLOAD_COMMAND, CVS_*, SVN_*, or URL options. The URL option may refer locally to a directory or source tarball, or refer to a remote tarball (e.g. http://.../src.tgz).


The 'ExternalProject_Add_Step' function adds a custom step to an external project:


.nf
  ExternalProject_Add_Step(<name> <step> # Names of project and custom step
    [COMMAND cmd...]        # Command line invoked by this step
    [COMMENT "text..."]     # Text printed when step executes
    [DEPENDEES steps...]    # Steps on which this step depends
    [DEPENDERS steps...]    # Steps that depend on this step
    [DEPENDS files...]      # Files on which this step depends
    [ALWAYS 1]              # No stamp file, step always runs
    [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir] # Working directory for command
    [LOG 1]                 # Wrap step in script to log output
    )
.fi

The command line, comment, and working directory of every standard and custom step is processed to replace tokens <SOURCE_DIR>, <BINARY_DIR>, <INSTALL_DIR>, and <TMP_DIR> with corresponding property values.


The 'ExternalProject_Get_Property' function retrieves external project target properties:


.nf
  ExternalProject_Get_Property(<name> [prop1 [prop2 [...]]])
.fi

It stores property values in variables of the same name. Property names correspond to the keyword argument names of 'ExternalProject_Add'.


The 'ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets' function generates custom targets for the steps listed:


.nf
  ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets(<name> [step1 [step2 [...]]])
.fi




If STEP_TARGETS is set then ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets is automatically called at the end of matching calls to ExternalProject_Add_Step. Pass STEP_TARGETS explicitly to individual ExternalProject_Add calls, or implicitly to all ExternalProject_Add calls by setting the directory property EP_STEP_TARGETS.


If STEP_TARGETS is not set, clients may still manually call ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets after calling ExternalProject_Add or ExternalProject_Add_Step.


This functionality is provided to make it easy to drive the steps independently of each other by specifying targets on build command lines. For example, you may be submitting to a sub\-project based dashboard, where you want to drive the configure portion of the build, then submit to the dashboard, followed by the build portion, followed by tests. If you invoke a custom target that depends on a step halfway through the step dependency chain, then all the previous steps will also run to ensure everything is up to date.


For example, to drive configure, build and test steps independently for each ExternalProject_Add call in your project, write the following line prior to any ExternalProject_Add calls in your CMakeLists file:


.nf
   set_property(DIRECTORY PROPERTY EP_STEP_TARGETS configure build test)
.fi

.B FeatureSummary
Macros for generating a summary of enabled/disabled features




This module provides the macros feature_summary(), set_package_properties() and add_feature_info(). For compatibility it also still provides set_package_info(), set_feature_info(), print_enabled_features() and print_disabled_features().


These macros can be used to generate a summary of enabled and disabled packages and/or feature for a build tree:

    FEATURE_SUMMARY( [FILENAME <file>]
                     [APPEND]
                     [VAR <variable_name>]

                   )
.fi




The FEATURE_SUMMARY() macro can be used to print information about enabled or disabled packages or features of a project. By default, only the names of the features/packages will be printed and their required version when one was specified. Use SET_PACKAGE_PROPERTIES() to add more useful information, like e.g. a download URL for the respective package or their purpose in the project.


The WHAT option is the only mandatory option. Here you specify what information will be printed:


.nf
    ALL: print everything
    ENABLED_FEATURES: the list of all features which are enabled
    DISABLED_FEATURES: the list of all features which are disabled
    PACKAGES_FOUND: the list of all packages which have been found
    PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND: the list of all packages which have not been found
    OPTIONAL_PACKAGES_FOUND: only those packages which have been found which have the type OPTIONAL
    OPTIONAL_PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND: only those packages which have not been found which have the type OPTIONAL
    RECOMMENDED_PACKAGES_FOUND: only those packages which have been found which have the type RECOMMENDED
    RECOMMENDED_PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND: only those packages which have not been found which have the type RECOMMENDED
    REQUIRED_PACKAGES_FOUND: only those packages which have been found which have the type REQUIRED
    REQUIRED_PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND: only those packages which have not been found which have the type REQUIRED
    RUNTIME_PACKAGES_FOUND: only those packages which have been found which have the type RUNTIME
    RUNTIME_PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND: only those packages which have not been found which have the type RUNTIME
.fi




If a FILENAME is given, the information is printed into this file. If APPEND is used, it is appended to this file, otherwise the file is overwritten if it already existed. If the VAR option is used, the information is "printed" into the specified variable. If FILENAME is not used, the information is printed to the terminal. Using the DESCRIPTION option a description or headline can be set which will be printed above the actual content. If INCLUDE_QUIET_PACKAGES is given, packages which have been searched with find_package(... QUIET) will also be listed. By default they are skipped. If FATAL_ON_MISSING_REQUIRED_PACKAGES is given, CMake will abort if a package which is marked as REQUIRED has not been found.


Example 1, append everything to a file:


.nf
   feature_summary(WHAT ALL
                   FILENAME ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/all.log APPEND)
.fi




Example 2, print the enabled features into the variable enabledFeaturesText, including QUIET packages:


.nf
   feature_summary(WHAT ENABLED_FEATURES
                   INCLUDE_QUIET_PACKAGES
                   DESCRIPTION "Enabled Features:"
                   VAR enabledFeaturesText)
   message(STATUS "${enabledFeaturesText}")
.fi







.nf
    SET_PACKAGE_PROPERTIES(<name> PROPERTIES [ URL <url> ]
                                             [ DESCRIPTION <description> ]

                                             [ PURPOSE <purpose> ]
                          )
.fi




Use this macro to set up information about the named package, which can then be displayed via FEATURE_SUMMARY(). This can be done either directly in the Find\-module or in the project which uses the module after the find_package() call. The features for which information can be set are added automatically by the find_package() command.


URL: this should be the homepage of the package, or something similar. Ideally this is set already directly in the Find\-module.


DESCRIPTION: A short description what that package is, at most one sentence. Ideally this is set already directly in the Find\-module.


TYPE: What type of dependency has the using project on that package. Default is OPTIONAL. In this case it is a package which can be used by the project when available at buildtime, but it also work without. RECOMMENDED is similar to OPTIONAL, i.e. the project will build if the package is not present, but the functionality of the resulting binaries will be severly limited. If a REQUIRED package is not available at buildtime, the project may not even build. This can be combined with the FATAL_ON_MISSING_REQUIRED_PACKAGES argument for feature_summary(). Last, a RUNTIME package is a package which is actually not used at all during the build, but which is required for actually running the resulting binaries. So if such a package is missing, the project can still be built, but it may not work later on. If set_package_properties() is called multiple times for the same package with different TYPEs, the TYPE is only changed to higher TYPEs ( RUNTIME < OPTIONAL < RECOMMENDED < REQUIRED ), lower TYPEs are ignored. The TYPE property is project\-specific, so it cannot be set by the Find\-module, but must be set in the project.


PURPOSE: This describes which features this package enables in the project, i.e. it tells the user what functionality he gets in the resulting binaries. If set_package_properties() is called multiple times for a package, all PURPOSE properties are appended to a list of purposes of the package in the project. As the TYPE property, also the PURPOSE property is project\-specific, so it cannot be set by the Find\-module, but must be set in the project.





Example for setting the info for a package:


.nf
   find_package(LibXml2)
   set_package_properties(LibXml2 PROPERTIES DESCRIPTION "A XML processing library."
                                             URL "http://xmlsoft.org/")
.fi




.nf
   set_package_properties(LibXml2 PROPERTIES TYPE RECOMMENDED
                                             PURPOSE "Enables HTML\-import in MyWordProcessor")
   ...
   set_package_properties(LibXml2 PROPERTIES TYPE OPTIONAL
                                             PURPOSE "Enables odt\-export in MyWordProcessor")

                                             PURPOSE "Necessary to disable the screensaver during a presentation" )
.fi




.nf
    ADD_FEATURE_INFO(<name> <enabled> <description>)
.fi

Use this macro to add information about a feature with the given <name>. <enabled> contains whether this feature is enabled or not, <description> is a text describing the feature. The information can be displayed using feature_summary() for ENABLED_FEATURES and DISABLED_FEATURES respectively.


Example for setting the info for a feature:


.nf
   option(WITH_FOO "Help for foo" ON)
   add_feature_info(Foo WITH_FOO "The Foo feature provides very cool stuff.")
.fi







The following macros are provided for compatibility with previous CMake versions:


.nf
    SET_PACKAGE_INFO(<name> <description> [<url> [<purpose>] ] )
.fi

Use this macro to set up information about the named package, which can then be displayed via FEATURE_SUMMARY(). This can be done either directly in the Find\-module or in the project which uses the module after the find_package() call. The features for which information can be set are added automatically by the find_package() command.


.nf
    PRINT_ENABLED_FEATURES()
.fi

Does the same as FEATURE_SUMMARY(WHAT ENABLED_FEATURES  DESCRIPTION "Enabled features:")


.nf

.fi




The minimum required version of bison can be specified using the standard CMake syntax, e.g. find_package(BISON 2.1.3)


If bison is found, the module defines the macros:


.nf
  BISON_TARGET(<Name> <YaccInput> <CodeOutput> [VERBOSE <file>]
              [COMPILE_FLAGS <string>])
.fi

which will create  a custom rule to generate  a parser. <YaccInput> is the path to  a yacc file. <CodeOutput> is the name  of the source file generated by bison.  A header file is also  be generated, and contains the  token  list.  If  COMPILE_FLAGS  option is  specified,  the  next parameter is  added in the bison  command line.  if  VERBOSE option is specified, <file> is created  and contains verbose descriptions of the grammar and parser. The macro defines a set of variables:


.nf
  BISON_${Name}_DEFINED \- true is the macro ran successfully
  BISON_${Name}_INPUT \- The input source file, an alias for <YaccInput>
  BISON_${Name}_OUTPUT_SOURCE \- The source file generated by bison

.B FindBoost
Find Boost include dirs and libraries

Use this module by invoking find_package with the form:


.nf
  find_package(Boost
    [version] [EXACT]      # Minimum or EXACT version e.g. 1.36.0
    [REQUIRED]             # Fail with error if Boost is not found
    [COMPONENTS <libs>...] # Boost libraries by their canonical name
    )                      # e.g. "date_time" for "libboost_date_time"
.fi

This module finds headers and requested component libraries OR a CMake package configuration file provided by a "Boost CMake" build.  For the latter case skip to the "Boost CMake" section below.  For the former case results are reported in variables:


.nf
  Boost_FOUND            \- True if headers and requested libraries were found
  Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS     \- Boost include directories
  Boost_LIBRARY_DIRS     \- Link directories for Boost libraries
  Boost_LIBRARIES        \- Boost component libraries to be linked
  Boost_<C>_FOUND        \- True if component <C> was found (<C> is upper\-case)
  Boost_<C>_LIBRARY      \- Libraries to link for component <C> (may include
                           target_link_libraries debug/optimized keywords)
  Boost_VERSION          \- BOOST_VERSION value from boost/version.hpp
  Boost_LIB_VERSION      \- Version string appended to library filenames
  Boost_MAJOR_VERSION    \- Boost major version number (X in X.y.z)
  Boost_MINOR_VERSION    \- Boost minor version number (Y in x.Y.z)
  Boost_SUBMINOR_VERSION \- Boost subminor version number (Z in x.y.Z)
  Boost_LIB_DIAGNOSTIC_DEFINITIONS (Windows)
                         \- Pass to add_definitions() to have diagnostic
                           information about Boost's automatic linking
                           displayed during compilation
.fi




This module reads hints about search locations from variables:


.nf
  BOOST_ROOT             \- Preferred installation prefix
   (or BOOSTROOT)
  BOOST_INCLUDEDIR       \- Preferred include directory e.g. <prefix>/include
  BOOST_LIBRARYDIR       \- Preferred library directory e.g. <prefix>/lib
  Boost_NO_SYSTEM_PATHS  \- Set to ON to disable searching in locations not
                           specified by these hint variables. Default is OFF.
  Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS
                         \- List of Boost versions not known to this module
                           (Boost install locations may contain the version)
.fi

and saves search results persistently in CMake cache entries:


.nf
  Boost_INCLUDE_DIR         \- Directory containing Boost headers
  Boost_LIBRARY_DIR         \- Directory containing Boost libraries
  Boost_<C>_LIBRARY_DEBUG   \- Component <C> library debug variant
  Boost_<C>_LIBRARY_RELEASE \- Component <C> library release variant
.fi

Users may set the these hints or results as cache entries.  Projects should not read these entries directly but instead use the above result variables. Note that some hint names start in upper\-case "BOOST".  One may specify these as environment variables if they are not specified as CMake variables or cache entries.


This module first searches for the Boost header files using the above hint variables (excluding BOOST_LIBRARYDIR) and saves the result in Boost_INCLUDE_DIR.  Then it searches for requested component libraries using the above hints (excluding BOOST_INCLUDEDIR and Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS), "lib" directories near Boost_INCLUDE_DIR, and the library name configuration settings below.  It saves the library directory in Boost_LIBRARY_DIR and individual library locations in Boost_<C>_LIBRARY_DEBUG and Boost_<C>_LIBRARY_RELEASE.  When one changes settings used by previous searches in the same build tree (excluding environment variables) this module discards previous search results affected by the changes and searches again.


Boost libraries come in many variants encoded in their file name.  Users or projects may tell this module which variant to find by setting variables:


.nf
  Boost_USE_MULTITHREADED  \- Set to OFF to use the non\-multithreaded
                             libraries ('mt' tag).  Default is ON.
  Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS    \- Set to ON to force the use of the static
                             libraries.  Default is OFF.
  Boost_USE_STATIC_RUNTIME \- Set to ON or OFF to specify whether to use
                             libraries linked statically to the C++ runtime
                             ('s' tag).  Default is platform dependent.
  Boost_USE_DEBUG_PYTHON   \- Set to ON to use libraries compiled with a
                             debug Python build ('y' tag). Default is OFF.
  Boost_USE_STLPORT        \- Set to ON to use libraries compiled with
                             STLPort ('p' tag).  Default is OFF.
  Boost_USE_STLPORT_DEPRECATED_NATIVE_IOSTREAMS
                           \- Set to ON to use libraries compiled with
                             STLPort deprecated "native iostreams"
                             ('n' tag).  Default is OFF.
  Boost_COMPILER           \- Set to the compiler\-specific library suffix
                             (e.g. "\-gcc43").  Default is auto\-computed
                             for the C++ compiler in use.
  Boost_THREADAPI          \- Suffix for "thread" component library name,
                             such as "pthread" or "win32".  Names with
                             and without this suffix will both be tried.
.fi

Other variables one may set to control this module are:


.nf
  Boost_DEBUG              \- Set to ON to enable debug output from FindBoost.
                             Please enable this before filing any bug report.
  Boost_DETAILED_FAILURE_MSG
                           \- Set to ON to add detailed information to the
                             failure message even when the REQUIRED option
                             is not given to the find_package call.
  Boost_REALPATH           \- Set to ON to resolve symlinks for discovered
                             libraries to assist with packaging.  For example,
                             the "system" component library may be resolved to
                             "/usr/lib/libboost_system.so.1.42.0" instead of
                             "/usr/lib/libboost_system.so".  This does not
                             affect linking and should not be enabled unless
                             the user needs this information.
.fi

On Visual Studio and Borland compilers Boost headers request automatic linking to corresponding libraries.  This requires matching libraries to be linked explicitly or available in the link library search path.  In this case setting Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS to OFF may not achieve dynamic linking. Boost automatic linking typically requests static libraries with a few exceptions (such as Boost.Python).  Use


.nf
  add_definitions(${Boost_LIB_DIAGNOSTIC_DEFINITIONS})
.fi

to ask Boost to report information about automatic linking requests.


Example to find Boost headers only:


.nf
  find_package(Boost 1.36.0)
  if(Boost_FOUND)
    include_directories(${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS})
    add_executable(foo foo.cc)
  endif()
.fi

Example to find Boost headers and some libraries:


.nf
  set(Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS        ON)
  set(Boost_USE_MULTITHREADED      ON)
  set(Boost_USE_STATIC_RUNTIME    OFF)
  find_package(Boost 1.36.0 COMPONENTS date_time filesystem system ...)
  if(Boost_FOUND)
    include_directories(${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS})
    add_executable(foo foo.cc)
    target_link_libraries(foo ${Boost_LIBRARIES})
  endif()
.fi

If Boost was built using the boost\-cmake project it provides a package configuration file for use with find_package's Config mode.  This module looks for the package configuration file called BoostConfig.cmake or boost\-config.cmake and stores the result in cache entry "Boost_DIR".  If found, the package configuration file is loaded and this module returns with no further action.  See documentation of the Boost CMake package configuration for details on what it provides.


Set Boost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE to ON to disable the search for boost\-cmake.

.B FindCABLE
Find CABLE

This module finds if CABLE is installed and determines where the include files and libraries are.  This code sets the following variables:


.nf
  CABLE             the path to the cable executable
  CABLE_TCL_LIBRARY the path to the Tcl wrapper library
  CABLE_INCLUDE_DIR the path to the include directory
.fi




To build Tcl wrappers, you should add shared library and link it to ${CABLE_TCL_LIBRARY}.  You should also add ${CABLE_INCLUDE_DIR} as an include directory.

.TP
.B FindCUDA
Tools for building CUDA C files: libraries and build dependencies.

This script locates the NVIDIA CUDA C tools. It should work on linux, windows, and mac and should be reasonably up to date with CUDA C releases.


This script makes use of the standard find_package arguments of <VERSION>, REQUIRED and QUIET.  CUDA_FOUND will report if an acceptable version of CUDA was found.


The script will prompt the user to specify CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR if the prefix cannot be determined by the location of nvcc in the system path and REQUIRED is specified to find_package(). To use a different installed version of the toolkit set the environment variable CUDA_BIN_PATH before running cmake (e.g. CUDA_BIN_PATH=/usr/local/cuda1.0 instead of the default /usr/local/cuda) or set CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR after configuring.  If you change the value of CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR, various components that depend on the path will be relocated.


It might be necessary to set CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR manually on certain platforms, or to use a cuda runtime not installed in the default location. In newer versions of the toolkit the cuda library is included with the graphics driver\- be sure that the driver version matches what is needed by the cuda runtime version.


The following variables affect the behavior of the macros in the script (in alphebetical order).  Note that any of these flags can be changed multiple times in the same directory before calling CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE, CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY, CUDA_COMPILE, CUDA_COMPILE_PTX or CUDA_WRAP_SRCS.


.nf
  CUDA_64_BIT_DEVICE_CODE (Default matches host bit size)
  \-\- Set to ON to compile for 64 bit device code, OFF for 32 bit device code.
     Note that making this different from the host code when generating object
     or C files from CUDA code just won't work, because size_t gets defined by
     nvcc in the generated source.  If you compile to PTX and then load the
     file yourself, you can mix bit sizes between device and host.
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_ATTACH_VS_BUILD_RULE_TO_CUDA_FILE (Default ON)
  \-\- Set to ON if you want the custom build rule to be attached to the source
     file in Visual Studio.  Turn OFF if you add the same cuda file to multiple
     targets.
.fi




.nf
     This allows the user to build the target from the CUDA file; however, bad
     things can happen if the CUDA source file is added to multiple targets.
     When performing parallel builds it is possible for the custom build
     command to be run more than once and in parallel causing cryptic build
     errors.  VS runs the rules for every source file in the target, and a
     source can have only one rule no matter how many projects it is added to.
     When the rule is run from multiple targets race conditions can occur on
     the generated file.  Eventually everything will get built, but if the user
     is unaware of this behavior, there may be confusion.  It would be nice if
     this script could detect the reuse of source files across multiple targets
     and turn the option off for the user, but no good solution could be found.
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_BUILD_CUBIN (Default OFF)
  \-\- Set to ON to enable and extra compilation pass with the \-cubin option in
     Device mode. The output is parsed and register, shared memory usage is
     printed during build.
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_BUILD_EMULATION (Default OFF for device mode)
  \-\- Set to ON for Emulation mode. \-D_DEVICEEMU is defined for CUDA C files
     when CUDA_BUILD_EMULATION is TRUE.
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_GENERATED_OUTPUT_DIR (Default CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR)
  \-\- Set to the path you wish to have the generated files placed.  If it is
     blank output files will be placed in CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR.
     Intermediate files will always be placed in
     CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR/CMakeFiles.
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_HOST_COMPILATION_CPP (Default ON)
  \-\- Set to OFF for C compilation of host code.
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_HOST_COMPILER (Default CMAKE_C_COMPILER, $(VCInstallDir)/bin for VS)
  \-\- Set the host compiler to be used by nvcc.  Ignored if \-ccbin or
     \-\-compiler\-bindir is already present in the CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS or
     CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS_<CONFIG> variables.  For Visual Studio targets
     $(VCInstallDir)/bin is a special value that expands out to the path when
     the command is run from withing VS.
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS
  CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS_<CONFIG>
  \-\- Additional NVCC command line arguments.  NOTE: multiple arguments must be
     semi\-colon delimited (e.g. \-\-compiler\-options;\-Wall)
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_PROPAGATE_HOST_FLAGS (Default ON)
  \-\- Set to ON to propagate CMAKE_{C,CXX}_FLAGS and their configuration
     dependent counterparts (e.g. CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG) automatically to the
     host compiler through nvcc's \-Xcompiler flag.  This helps make the
     generated host code match the rest of the system better.  Sometimes
     certain flags give nvcc problems, and this will help you turn the flag
     propagation off.  This does not affect the flags supplied directly to nvcc
     via CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS or through the OPTION flags specified through
     CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY, CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE, or CUDA_WRAP_SRCS.  Flags used for
     shared library compilation are not affected by this flag.
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION (Default OFF)
  \-\- If set this will enable separable compilation for all CUDA runtime object
     files.  If used outside of CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE and CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY
     (e.g. calling CUDA_WRAP_SRCS directly),
     CUDA_COMPUTE_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECT_FILE_NAME and
     CUDA_LINK_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECTS should be called.
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_VERBOSE_BUILD (Default OFF)
  \-\- Set to ON to see all the commands used when building the CUDA file.  When
     using a Makefile generator the value defaults to VERBOSE (run make
     VERBOSE=1 to see output), although setting CUDA_VERBOSE_BUILD to ON will
     always print the output.
.fi




The script creates the following macros (in alphebetical order):


.nf
  CUDA_ADD_CUFFT_TO_TARGET( cuda_target )
  \-\- Adds the cufft library to the target (can be any target).  Handles whether
     you are in emulation mode or not.
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_ADD_CUBLAS_TO_TARGET( cuda_target )
  \-\- Adds the cublas library to the target (can be any target).  Handles
     whether you are in emulation mode or not.
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE( cuda_target file0 file1 ...
                       [WIN32] [MACOSX_BUNDLE] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL] [OPTIONS ...] )
  \-\- Creates an executable "cuda_target" which is made up of the files
     specified.  All of the non CUDA C files are compiled using the standard
     build rules specified by CMAKE and the cuda files are compiled to object
     files using nvcc and the host compiler.  In addition CUDA_INCLUDE_DIRS is
     added automatically to include_directories().  Some standard CMake target
     calls can be used on the target after calling this macro
     (e.g. set_target_properties and target_link_libraries), but setting
     properties that adjust compilation flags will not affect code compiled by
     nvcc.  Such flags should be modified before calling CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE,
     CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY or CUDA_WRAP_SRCS.
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY( cuda_target file0 file1 ...
                    [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL] [OPTIONS ...] )
  \-\- Same as CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE except that a library is created.
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_BUILD_CLEAN_TARGET()
  \-\- Creates a convience target that deletes all the dependency files
     generated.  You should make clean after running this target to ensure the
     dependency files get regenerated.
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_COMPILE( generated_files file0 file1 ... [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE]
                [OPTIONS ...] )
  \-\- Returns a list of generated files from the input source files to be used
     with ADD_LIBRARY or ADD_EXECUTABLE.
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_COMPILE_PTX( generated_files file0 file1 ... [OPTIONS ...] )
  \-\- Returns a list of PTX files generated from the input source files.
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_COMPUTE_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECT_FILE_NAME( output_file_var
                                                       cuda_target
                                                       object_files )
  \-\- Compute the name of the intermediate link file used for separable
     compilation.  This file name is typically passed into
     CUDA_LINK_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECTS.  output_file_var is produced
     based on cuda_target the list of objects files that need separable
     compilation as specified by object_files.  If the object_files list is
     empty, then output_file_var will be empty.  This function is called
     automatically for CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY and CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE.  Note that
     this is a function and not a macro.
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES( path0 path1 ... )
  \-\- Sets the directories that should be passed to nvcc
     (e.g. nvcc \-Ipath0 \-Ipath1 ... ). These paths usually contain other .cu
     files.
.fi







.nf
  CUDA_LINK_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECTS( output_file_var cuda_target
                                           nvcc_flags object_files)
.fi




.nf
  \-\- Generates the link object required by separable compilation from the given
     object files.  This is called automatically for CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE and
     CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY, but can be called manually when using CUDA_WRAP_SRCS
     directly.  When called from CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY or CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE the
     nvcc_flags passed in are the same as the flags passed in via the OPTIONS
     argument.  The only nvcc flag added automatically is the bitness flag as
     specified by CUDA_64_BIT_DEVICE_CODE.  Note that this is a function
     instead of a macro.
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_WRAP_SRCS ( cuda_target format generated_files file0 file1 ...
                   [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE] [OPTIONS ...] )
  \-\- This is where all the magic happens.  CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE,
     CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY, CUDA_COMPILE, and CUDA_COMPILE_PTX all call this
     function under the hood.
.fi




.nf
     Given the list of files (file0 file1 ... fileN) this macro generates
     custom commands that generate either PTX or linkable objects (use "PTX" or
     "OBJ" for the format argument to switch).  Files that don't end with .cu
     or have the HEADER_FILE_ONLY property are ignored.
.fi




.nf
     The arguments passed in after OPTIONS are extra command line options to
     give to nvcc.  You can also specify per configuration options by
     specifying the name of the configuration followed by the options.  General
     options must preceed configuration specific options.  Not all
     configurations need to be specified, only the ones provided will be used.
.fi




.nf
        OPTIONS \-DFLAG=2 "\-DFLAG_OTHER=space in flag"
        DEBUG \-g
        RELEASE \-\-use_fast_math
        RELWITHDEBINFO \-\-use_fast_math;\-g
        MINSIZEREL \-\-use_fast_math
.fi




.nf
     For certain configurations (namely VS generating object files with
     CUDA_ATTACH_VS_BUILD_RULE_TO_CUDA_FILE set to ON), no generated file will
     be produced for the given cuda file.  This is because when you add the
     cuda file to Visual Studio it knows that this file produces an object file
     and will link in the resulting object file automatically.
.fi




.nf
     This script will also generate a separate cmake script that is used at
     build time to invoke nvcc.  This is for several reasons.
.fi




.nf
       1. nvcc can return negative numbers as return values which confuses
       Visual Studio into thinking that the command succeeded.  The script now
       checks the error codes and produces errors when there was a problem.
.fi




.nf
       2. nvcc has been known to not delete incomplete results when it
       encounters problems.  This confuses build systems into thinking the
       target was generated when in fact an unusable file exists.  The script
       now deletes the output files if there was an error.
.fi




.nf
       3. By putting all the options that affect the build into a file and then
       make the build rule dependent on the file, the output files will be
       regenerated when the options change.
.fi




.nf
     This script also looks at optional arguments STATIC, SHARED, or MODULE to
     determine when to target the object compilation for a shared library.
     BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is ignored in CUDA_WRAP_SRCS, but it is respected in
     CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY.  On some systems special flags are added for building
     objects intended for shared libraries.  A preprocessor macro,
     <target_name>_EXPORTS is defined when a shared library compilation is
     detected.
.fi




.nf
     Flags passed into add_definitions with \-D or /D are passed along to nvcc.
.fi




The script defines the following variables:


.nf
  CUDA_VERSION_MAJOR    \-\- The major version of cuda as reported by nvcc.
  CUDA_VERSION_MINOR    \-\- The minor version.
  CUDA_VERSION
  CUDA_VERSION_STRING   \-\- CUDA_VERSION_MAJOR.CUDA_VERSION_MINOR
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR \-\- Path to the CUDA Toolkit (defined if not set).
  CUDA_SDK_ROOT_DIR     \-\- Path to the CUDA SDK.  Use this to find files in the
                           SDK.  This script will not directly support finding
                           specific libraries or headers, as that isn't
                           supported by NVIDIA.  If you want to change
                           libraries when the path changes see the
                           FindCUDA.cmake script for an example of how to clear
                           these variables.  There are also examples of how to
                           use the CUDA_SDK_ROOT_DIR to locate headers or
                           libraries, if you so choose (at your own risk).
  CUDA_INCLUDE_DIRS     \-\- Include directory for cuda headers.  Added automatically
                           for CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE and CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY.
  CUDA_LIBRARIES        \-\- Cuda RT library.
  CUDA_CUFFT_LIBRARIES  \-\- Device or emulation library for the Cuda FFT
                           implementation (alternative to:

  CUDA_CUBLAS_LIBRARIES \-\- Device or emulation library for the Cuda BLAS
                           implementation (alterative to:
                           CUDA_ADD_CUBLAS_TO_TARGET macro).
  CUDA_cupti_LIBRARY    \-\- CUDA Profiling Tools Interface library.

.nf

This module locates the developer's image library. http://openil.sourceforge.net/


This module sets:


.nf
   IL_LIBRARIES \-   the name of the IL library. These include the full path to
                    the core DevIL library. This one has to be linked into the
                    application.
   ILU_LIBRARIES \-  the name of the ILU library. Again, the full path. This
                    library is for filters and effects, not actual loading. It
                    doesn't have to be linked if the functionality it provides
                    is not used.
   ILUT_LIBRARIES \- the name of the ILUT library. Full path. This part of the
                    library interfaces with OpenGL. It is not strictly needed
                    in applications.
   IL_INCLUDE_DIR \- where to find the il.h, ilu.h and ilut.h files.
   IL_FOUND \-       this is set to TRUE if all the above variables were set.
                    This will be set to false if ILU or ILUT are not found,
                    even if they are not needed. In most systems, if one
                    library is found all the others are as well. That's the
                    way the DevIL developers release it.

.nf
   DOXYGEN_SKIP_DOT       = If true this module will skip trying to find Dot
                            (an optional component often used by Doxygen)
.fi




This modules defines the following variables:


.nf
   DOXYGEN_EXECUTABLE     = The path to the doxygen command.
   DOXYGEN_FOUND          = Was Doxygen found or not?
   DOXYGEN_VERSION        = The version reported by doxygen \-\-version
.fi




.nf
   DOXYGEN_DOT_EXECUTABLE = The path to the dot program used by doxygen.
   DOXYGEN_DOT_FOUND      = Was Dot found or not?
   DOXYGEN_DOT_PATH       = The path to dot not including the executable
.fi







.TP
.B FindEXPAT
Find expat

Find the native EXPAT headers and libraries.


.nf

.TP
.B FindFLEX
Find flex executable and provides a macro to generate custom build rules




The module defines the following variables:


.nf
  FLEX_FOUND \- true is flex executable is found
  FLEX_EXECUTABLE \- the path to the flex executable
  FLEX_VERSION \- the version of flex
  FLEX_LIBRARIES \- The flex libraries
  FLEX_INCLUDE_DIRS \- The path to the flex headers
.fi




The minimum required version of flex can be specified using the standard syntax, e.g. find_package(FLEX 2.5.13)





If flex is found on the system, the module provides the macro:


.nf
  FLEX_TARGET(Name FlexInput FlexOutput [COMPILE_FLAGS <string>])
.fi

which creates a custom command  to generate the <FlexOutput> file from the <FlexInput> file.  If  COMPILE_FLAGS option is specified, the next parameter is added to the flex  command line. Name is an alias used to get  details of  this custom  command.  Indeed the  macro defines  the following variables:


.nf
  FLEX_${Name}_DEFINED \- true is the macro ran successfully
  FLEX_${Name}_OUTPUTS \- the source file generated by the custom rule, an
  alias for FlexOutput
  FLEX_${Name}_INPUT \- the flex source file, an alias for ${FlexInput}
.fi




Flex scanners oftenly use tokens  defined by Bison: the code generated by Flex  depends of the header  generated by Bison.   This module also defines a macro:


.nf
  ADD_FLEX_BISON_DEPENDENCY(FlexTarget BisonTarget)
.fi

which  adds the  required dependency  between a  scanner and  a parser where  <FlexTarget>  and <BisonTarget>  are  the  first parameters  of respectively FLEX_TARGET and BISON_TARGET macros.


.nf
  ====================================================================
  Example:
.fi




.nf
   find_package(BISON)
   find_package(FLEX)
.fi




.nf
   BISON_TARGET(MyParser parser.y ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/parser.cpp)
   FLEX_TARGET(MyScanner lexer.l  ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/lexer.cpp)
   ADD_FLEX_BISON_DEPENDENCY(MyScanner MyParser)
.fi




.nf
   include_directories(${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR})
   add_executable(Foo
      Foo.cc
      ${BISON_MyParser_OUTPUTS}
      ${FLEX_MyScanner_OUTPUTS}
   )

.TP
.B FindHDF5
Find HDF5, a library for reading and writing self describing array data.




This module invokes the HDF5 wrapper compiler that should be installed alongside HDF5.  Depending upon the HDF5 Configuration, the wrapper compiler is called either h5cc or h5pcc.  If this succeeds, the module will then call the compiler with the \-show argument to see what flags are used when compiling an HDF5 client application.


The module will optionally accept the COMPONENTS argument.  If no COMPONENTS are specified, then the find module will default to finding only the HDF5 C library.  If one or more COMPONENTS are specified, the module will attempt to find the language bindings for the specified components.  The only valid components are C, CXX, Fortran, HL, and Fortran_HL.  If the COMPONENTS argument is not given, the module will attempt to find only the C bindings.


On UNIX systems, this module will read the variable HDF5_USE_STATIC_LIBRARIES to determine whether or not to prefer a static link to a dynamic link for HDF5 and all of it's dependencies.  To use this feature, make sure that the HDF5_USE_STATIC_LIBRARIES variable is set before the call to find_package.


To provide the module with a hint about where to find your HDF5 installation, you can set the environment variable HDF5_ROOT.  The Find module will then look in this path when searching for HDF5 executables, paths, and libraries.


In addition to finding the includes and libraries required to compile an HDF5 client application, this module also makes an effort to find tools that come with the HDF5 distribution that may be useful for regression testing.


This module will define the following variables:


.nf

KDE3_AUTOMOC(file1 ... fileN)


.nf
    Call this if you want to have automatic moc file handling.
    This means if you include "foo.moc" in the source file foo.cpp
    a moc file for the header foo.h will be created automatically.
    You can set the property SKIP_AUTOMAKE using set_source_files_properties()
    to exclude some files in the list from being processed.
.fi




KDE3_ADD_MOC_FILES(SRCS_VAR file1 ... fileN )


.nf
    If you don't use the KDE3_AUTOMOC() macro, for the files
    listed here moc files will be created (named "foo.moc.cpp")

.B FindMPI
Find a Message Passing Interface (MPI) implementation

The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a library used to write high\-performance distributed\-memory parallel applications, and is typically deployed on a cluster. MPI is a standard interface (defined by the MPI forum) for which many implementations are available. All of them have somewhat different include paths, libraries to link against, etc., and this module tries to smooth out those differences.


=== Variables ===


This module will set the following variables per language in your project, where <lang> is one of C, CXX, or Fortran:


.nf
   MPI_<lang>_FOUND           TRUE if FindMPI found MPI flags for <lang>
   MPI_<lang>_COMPILER        MPI Compiler wrapper for <lang>
   MPI_<lang>_COMPILE_FLAGS   Compilation flags for MPI programs
   MPI_<lang>_INCLUDE_PATH    Include path(s) for MPI header
   MPI_<lang>_LINK_FLAGS      Linking flags for MPI programs
   MPI_<lang>_LIBRARIES       All libraries to link MPI programs against
.fi

Additionally, FindMPI sets the following variables for running MPI programs from the command line:


.nf
   MPIEXEC                    Executable for running MPI programs
   MPIEXEC_NUMPROC_FLAG       Flag to pass to MPIEXEC before giving
                              it the number of processors to run on
   MPIEXEC_PREFLAGS           Flags to pass to MPIEXEC directly
                              before the executable to run.
   MPIEXEC_POSTFLAGS          Flags to pass to MPIEXEC after other flags
.fi

=== Usage ===


To use this module, simply call FindMPI from a CMakeLists.txt file, or run find_package(MPI), then run CMake.  If you are happy with the auto\- detected configuration for your language, then you're done.  If not, you have two options:


.nf
   1. Set MPI_<lang>_COMPILER to the MPI wrapper (mpicc, etc.) of your
      choice and reconfigure.  FindMPI will attempt to determine all the
      necessary variables using THAT compiler's compile and link flags.
   2. If this fails, or if your MPI implementation does not come with
      a compiler wrapper, then set both MPI_<lang>_LIBRARIES and
      MPI_<lang>_INCLUDE_PATH.  You may also set any other variables
      listed above, but these two are required.  This will circumvent
      autodetection entirely.
.fi

When configuration is successful, MPI_<lang>_COMPILER will be set to the compiler wrapper for <lang>, if it was found.  MPI_<lang>_FOUND and other variables above will be set if any MPI implementation was found for <lang>, regardless of whether a compiler was found.


When using MPIEXEC to execute MPI applications, you should typically use all of the MPIEXEC flags as follows:


.nf
   ${MPIEXEC} ${MPIEXEC_NUMPROC_FLAG} PROCS
     ${MPIEXEC_PREFLAGS} EXECUTABLE ${MPIEXEC_POSTFLAGS} ARGS
.fi

where PROCS is the number of processors on which to execute the program, EXECUTABLE is the MPI program, and ARGS are the arguments to pass to the MPI program.


=== Backward Compatibility ===


For backward compatibility with older versions of FindMPI, these variables are set, but deprecated:


.nf
   MPI_FOUND           MPI_COMPILER        MPI_LIBRARY
   MPI_COMPILE_FLAGS   MPI_INCLUDE_PATH    MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY
   MPI_LINK_FLAGS      MPI_LIBRARIES
.fi

In new projects, please use the MPI_<lang>_XXX equivalents.

This module can be used to detect OpenMP support in a compiler. If the compiler supports OpenMP, the flags required to compile with OpenMP support are returned in variables for the different languages. The variables may be empty if the compiler does not need a special flag to support OpenMP.


The following variables are set:


.nf
   OpenMP_C_FLAGS \- flags to add to the C compiler for OpenMP support
   OpenMP_CXX_FLAGS \- flags to add to the CXX compiler for OpenMP support
   OPENMP_FOUND \- true if openmp is detected

.B FindOpenSceneGraph
Find OpenSceneGraph

This module searches for the OpenSceneGraph core "osg" library as well as OpenThreads, and whatever additional COMPONENTS (nodekits) that you specify.


.nf
    See http://www.openscenegraph.org
.fi




NOTE: To use this module effectively you must either require CMake >= 2.6.3 with cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.6.3) or download and place FindOpenThreads.cmake, Findosg_functions.cmake, Findosg.cmake, and Find<etc>.cmake files into your CMAKE_MODULE_PATH.


==================================


This module accepts the following variables (note mixed case)


.nf
    OpenSceneGraph_DEBUG \- Enable debugging output
.fi




.nf
    OpenSceneGraph_MARK_AS_ADVANCED \- Mark cache variables as advanced
                                      automatically
.fi




The following environment variables are also respected for finding the OSG and it's various components.  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH can also be used for this (see find_library() CMake documentation).


.nf
    <MODULE>_DIR (where MODULE is of the form "OSGVOLUME" and there is a FindosgVolume.cmake file)
    OSG_DIR
    OSGDIR
    OSG_ROOT
.fi




[CMake 2.8.10]: The CMake variable OSG_DIR can now be used as well to influence detection, instead of needing to specify an environment variable.


This module defines the following output variables:


.nf
    OPENSCENEGRAPH_FOUND \- Was the OSG and all of the specified components found?
.fi




.nf
    OPENSCENEGRAPH_VERSION \- The version of the OSG which was found
.fi




.nf

OpenThreads is a C++ based threading library. Its largest userbase seems to OpenSceneGraph so you might notice I accept OSGDIR as an environment path. I consider this part of the Findosg* suite used to find OpenSceneGraph components. Each component is separate and you must opt in to each module.


Locate OpenThreads This module defines OPENTHREADS_LIBRARY OPENTHREADS_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to OpenThreads OPENTHREADS_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find the headers


$OPENTHREADS_DIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the ./configure \-\-prefix=$OPENTHREADS_DIR used in building osg.

.B FindPNG
Find the native PNG includes and library




This module searches libpng, the library for working with PNG images.


It defines the following variables


.nf

.B FindPackageHandleStandardArgs
.nf
 
.fi

FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS(<name> ... )


This function is intended to be used in FindXXX.cmake modules files. It handles the REQUIRED, QUIET and version\-related arguments to find_package(). It also sets the <packagename>_FOUND variable. The package is considered found if all variables <var1>... listed contain valid results, e.g. valid filepaths.


There are two modes of this function. The first argument in both modes is the name of the Find\-module where it is called (in original casing).


The first simple mode looks like this:


.nf
    FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS(<name> (DEFAULT_MSG|"Custom failure message") <var1>...<varN> )
.fi

If the variables <var1> to <varN> are all valid, then <UPPERCASED_NAME>_FOUND will be set to TRUE. If DEFAULT_MSG is given as second argument, then the function will generate itself useful success and error messages. You can also supply a custom error message for the failure case. This is not recommended.


The second mode is more powerful and also supports version checking:


.nf
    FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS(NAME [FOUND_VAR <resultVar>]
                                           [REQUIRED_VARS <var1>...<varN>]
                                           [VERSION_VAR   <versionvar>]
                                           [HANDLE_COMPONENTS]
                                           [CONFIG_MODE]
                                           [FAIL_MESSAGE "Custom failure message"] )
.fi




In this mode, the name of the result\-variable can be set either to either <UPPERCASED_NAME>_FOUND or <OriginalCase_Name>_FOUND using the FOUND_VAR option. Other names for the result\-variable are not allowed. So for a Find\-module named FindFooBar.cmake, the two possible names are FooBar_FOUND and FOOBAR_FOUND. It is recommended to use the original case version. If the FOUND_VAR option is not used, the default is <UPPERCASED_NAME>_FOUND.


As in the simple mode, if <var1> through <varN> are all valid, <packagename>_FOUND will be set to TRUE. After REQUIRED_VARS the variables which are required for this package are listed. Following VERSION_VAR the name of the variable can be specified which holds the version of the package which has been found. If this is done, this version will be checked against the (potentially) specified required version used in the find_package() call. The EXACT keyword is also handled. The default messages include information about the required version and the version which has been actually found, both if the version is ok or not. If the package supports components, use the HANDLE_COMPONENTS option to enable handling them. In this case, find_package_handle_standard_args() will report which components have been found and which are missing, and the <packagename>_FOUND variable will be set to FALSE if any of the required components (i.e. not the ones listed after OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS) are missing. Use the option CONFIG_MODE if your FindXXX.cmake module is a wrapper for a find_package(... NO_MODULE) call.  In this case VERSION_VAR will be set to <NAME>_VERSION and the macro will automatically check whether the Config module was found. Via FAIL_MESSAGE a custom failure message can be specified, if this is not used, the default message will be displayed.


Example for mode 1:


.nf
    find_package_handle_standard_args(LibXml2  DEFAULT_MSG  LIBXML2_LIBRARY LIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR)
.fi




LibXml2 is considered to be found, if both LIBXML2_LIBRARY and LIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR are valid. Then also LIBXML2_FOUND is set to TRUE. If it is not found and REQUIRED was used, it fails with FATAL_ERROR, independent whether QUIET was used or not. If it is found, success will be reported, including the content of <var1>. On repeated Cmake runs, the same message won't be printed again.


Example for mode 2:


.nf
    find_package_handle_standard_args(LibXslt FOUND_VAR LibXslt_FOUND
                                             REQUIRED_VARS LibXslt_LIBRARIES LibXslt_INCLUDE_DIRS
                                             VERSION_VAR LibXslt_VERSION_STRING)
.fi

In this case, LibXslt is considered to be found if the variable(s) listed after REQUIRED_VAR are all valid, i.e. LibXslt_LIBRARIES and LibXslt_INCLUDE_DIRS in this case. The result will then be stored in LibXslt_FOUND . Also the version of LibXslt will be checked by using the version contained in LibXslt_VERSION_STRING. Since no FAIL_MESSAGE is given, the default messages will be printed.


Another example for mode 2:


.nf
    find_package(Automoc4 QUIET NO_MODULE HINTS /opt/automoc4)
    find_package_handle_standard_args(Automoc4  CONFIG_MODE)
.fi

In this case, FindAutmoc4.cmake wraps a call to find_package(Automoc4 NO_MODULE) and adds an additional search directory for automoc4. Here the result will be stored in AUTOMOC4_FOUND. The following FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS() call produces a proper success/error message.

.TP
.B FindPackageMessage
.nf
 
.fi

FIND_PACKAGE_MESSAGE(<name> "message for user" "find result details")


This macro is intended to be used in FindXXX.cmake modules files. It will print a message once for each unique find result. This is useful for telling the user where a package was found. The first argument specifies the name (XXX) of the package. The second argument specifies the message to display. The third argument lists details about the find result so that if they change the message will be displayed again. The macro also obeys the QUIET argument to the find_package command.


Example:


.nf
  if(X11_FOUND)
    FIND_PACKAGE_MESSAGE(X11 "Found X11: ${X11_X11_LIB}"
      "[${X11_X11_LIB}][${X11_INCLUDE_DIR}]")

.B FindPkgConfig
a pkg\-config module for CMake




Usage:


.nf

     checks for all the given modules
.fi




.nf
   pkg_search_module(<PREFIX> [REQUIRED] [QUIET] <MODULE> [<MODULE>]*)
     checks for given modules and uses the first working one
.fi




When the 'REQUIRED' argument was set, macros will fail with an error when module(s) could not be found


When the 'QUIET' argument is set, no status messages will be printed.


It sets the following variables:


.nf
   PKG_CONFIG_FOUND          ... if pkg\-config executable was found
   PKG_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE     ... pathname of the pkg\-config program
   PKG_CONFIG_VERSION_STRING ... the version of the pkg\-config program found
                                 (since CMake 2.8.8)
.fi




For the following variables two sets of values exist; first one is the common one and has the given PREFIX. The second set contains flags which are given out when pkgconfig was called with the '\-\-static' option.


.nf
   <XPREFIX>_FOUND          ... set to 1 if module(s) exist
   <XPREFIX>_LIBRARIES      ... only the libraries (w/o the '\-l')
   <XPREFIX>_LIBRARY_DIRS   ... the paths of the libraries (w/o the '\-L')
   <XPREFIX>_LDFLAGS        ... all required linker flags
   <XPREFIX>_LDFLAGS_OTHER  ... all other linker flags
   <XPREFIX>_INCLUDE_DIRS   ... the '\-I' preprocessor flags (w/o the '\-I')
   <XPREFIX>_CFLAGS         ... all required cflags
   <XPREFIX>_CFLAGS_OTHER   ... the other compiler flags
.fi




.nf
   <XPREFIX> = <PREFIX>        for common case
   <XPREFIX> = <PREFIX>_STATIC for static linking
.fi




There are some special variables whose prefix depends on the count of given modules. When there is only one module, <PREFIX> stays unchanged. When there are multiple modules, the prefix will be changed to <PREFIX>_<MODNAME>:


.nf
   <XPREFIX>_VERSION    ... version of the module
   <XPREFIX>_PREFIX     ... prefix\-directory of the module
   <XPREFIX>_INCLUDEDIR ... include\-dir of the module
   <XPREFIX>_LIBDIR     ... lib\-dir of the module
.fi




.nf
   <XPREFIX> = <PREFIX>  when |MODULES| == 1, else
   <XPREFIX> = <PREFIX>_<MODNAME>
.fi




A <MODULE> parameter can have the following formats:


.nf
   {MODNAME}            ... matches any version
   {MODNAME}>={VERSION} ... at least version <VERSION> is required
   {MODNAME}={VERSION}  ... exactly version <VERSION> is required
   {MODNAME}<={VERSION} ... modules must not be newer than <VERSION>
.fi

.B FindProducer
.nf
 
.fi

Though Producer isn't directly part of OpenSceneGraph, its primary user is OSG so I consider this part of the Findosg* suite used to find OpenSceneGraph components. You'll notice that I accept OSGDIR as an environment path.


Each component is separate and you must opt in to each module. You must also opt into OpenGL (and OpenThreads?) as these modules won't do it for you. This is to allow you control over your own system piece by piece in case you need to opt out of certain components or change the Find behavior for a particular module (perhaps because the default FindOpenGL.cmake module doesn't work with your system as an example). If you want to use a more convenient module that includes everything, use the FindOpenSceneGraph.cmake instead of the Findosg*.cmake modules.


Locate Producer This module defines PRODUCER_LIBRARY PRODUCER_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to Producer PRODUCER_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find the headers


$PRODUCER_DIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the ./configure \-\-prefix=$PRODUCER_DIR used in building osg.

.TP
.B FindQt
Searches for all installed versions of Qt.

This should only be used if your project can work with multiple versions of Qt.  If not, you should just directly use FindQt4 or FindQt3. If multiple versions of Qt are found on the machine, then The user must set the option DESIRED_QT_VERSION to the version they want to use.  If only one version of qt is found on the machine, then the DESIRED_QT_VERSION is set to that version and the matching FindQt3 or FindQt4 module is included. Once the user sets DESIRED_QT_VERSION, then the FindQt3 or FindQt4 module is included.


.nf
  QT_REQUIRED if this is set to TRUE then if CMake can
              not find Qt4 or Qt3 an error is raised
              and a message is sent to the user.

  DESIRED_QT_VERSION OPTION is created
  QT4_INSTALLED is set to TRUE if qt4 is found.
  QT3_INSTALLED is set to TRUE if qt3 is found.

If you need the multithreaded version of Qt, set QT_MT_REQUIRED to TRUE


Also defined, but not for general use are:


.nf
  QT_MOC_EXECUTABLE, where to find the moc tool.
  QT_UIC_EXECUTABLE, where to find the uic tool.
  QT_QT_LIBRARY, where to find the Qt library.
  QT_QTMAIN_LIBRARY, where to find the qtmain
   library. This is only required by Qt3 on Windows.
.fi

.TP
.B FindQt4
Find Qt 4

This module can be used to find Qt4. The most important issue is that the Qt4 qmake is available via the system path. This qmake is then used to detect basically everything else. This module defines a number of key variables and macros. The variable QT_USE_FILE is set which is the path to a CMake file that can be included to compile Qt 4 applications and libraries.  It sets up the compilation environment for include directories, preprocessor defines and populates a QT_LIBRARIES variable.


Typical usage could be something like:


.nf
   find_package(Qt4 4.4.3 REQUIRED QtCore QtGui QtXml)
   include(${QT_USE_FILE})
   add_executable(myexe main.cpp)
   target_link_libraries(myexe ${QT_LIBRARIES})
.fi




The minimum required version can be specified using the standard find_package()\-syntax (see example above). For compatibility with older versions of FindQt4.cmake it is also possible to set the variable QT_MIN_VERSION to the minimum required version of Qt4 before the find_package(Qt4) command. If both are used, the version used in the find_package() command overrides the one from QT_MIN_VERSION.


When using the components argument, QT_USE_QT* variables are automatically set for the QT_USE_FILE to pick up.  If one wishes to manually set them, the available ones to set include:


.nf
                    QT_DONT_USE_QTCORE
                    QT_DONT_USE_QTGUI

.nf
  QT_USE_IMPORTED_TARGETS
        If this variable is set to TRUE, FindQt4.cmake will create imported
        library targets for the various Qt libraries and set the
        library variables like QT_QTCORE_LIBRARY to point at these imported
        targets instead of the library file on disk. This provides much better
        handling of the release and debug versions of the Qt libraries and is
       also always backwards compatible, except for the case that dependencies
       of libraries are exported, these will then also list the names of the
       imported targets as dependency and not the file location on disk. This
       is much more flexible, but requires that FindQt4.cmake is executed before
       such an exported dependency file is processed.
.fi




.nf
       Note that if using IMPORTED targets, the qtmain.lib static library is
       automatically linked on Windows. To disable that globally, set the
       QT4_NO_LINK_QTMAIN variable before finding Qt4. To disable that for a
       particular executable, set the QT4_NO_LINK_QTMAIN target property to
       True on the executable.
.fi




.nf
  QT_INCLUDE_DIRS_NO_SYSTEM
        If this variable is set to TRUE, the Qt include directories
        in the QT_USE_FILE will NOT have the SYSTEM keyword set.

There are also some files that need processing by some Qt tools such as moc and uic.  Listed below are macros that may be used to process those files.


.nf
  macro QT4_WRAP_CPP(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS ...)
        create moc code from a list of files containing Qt class with
        the Q_OBJECT declaration.  Per\-directory preprocessor definitions
        are also added.  Options may be given to moc, such as those found
        when executing "moc \-help".
.fi




.nf
  macro QT4_WRAP_UI(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS ...)
        create code from a list of Qt designer ui files.
        Options may be given to uic, such as those found
        when executing "uic \-help"
.fi




.nf
  macro QT4_ADD_RESOURCES(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS ...)
        create code from a list of Qt resource files.
        Options may be given to rcc, such as those found
        when executing "rcc \-help"
.fi




.nf
  macro QT4_GENERATE_MOC(inputfile outputfile )
        creates a rule to run moc on infile and create outfile.
        Use this if for some reason QT4_WRAP_CPP() isn't appropriate, e.g.
        because you need a custom filename for the moc file or something similar.
.fi




.nf
  macro QT4_AUTOMOC(sourcefile1 sourcefile2 ... )
        This macro is still experimental.
        It can be used to have moc automatically handled.
        So if you have the files foo.h and foo.cpp, and in foo.h a
        a class uses the Q_OBJECT macro, moc has to run on it. If you don't
        want to use QT4_WRAP_CPP() (which is reliable and mature), you can insert
        #include "foo.moc"
        in foo.cpp and then give foo.cpp as argument to QT4_AUTOMOC(). This will the
        scan all listed files at cmake\-time for such included moc files and if it finds
        them cause a rule to be generated to run moc at build time on the
        accompanying header file foo.h.
        If a source file has the SKIP_AUTOMOC property set it will be ignored by this macro.
.fi




.nf
        You should have a look on the AUTOMOC property for targets to achieve the same results.

.nf
  macro QT4_ADD_DBUS_INTERFACE(outfiles interface basename)

.nf
  macro QT4_ADD_DBUS_ADAPTOR(outfiles xmlfile parentheader parentclassname [basename] [classname])
        create a dbus adaptor (header and implementation file) from the xml file
        describing the interface, and add it to the list of sources. The adaptor
        forwards the calls to a parent class, defined in parentheader and named
        parentclassname. The name of the generated files will be
        <basename>adaptor.{cpp,h} where basename defaults to the basename of the xml file.
        If <classname> is provided, then it will be used as the classname of the
        adaptor itself.
.fi




.nf
  macro QT4_GENERATE_DBUS_INTERFACE( header [interfacename] OPTIONS ...)
        generate the xml interface file from the given header.
        If the optional argument interfacename is omitted, the name of the
        interface file is constructed from the basename of the header with
        the suffix .xml appended.
        Options may be given to qdbuscpp2xml, such as those found when executing "qdbuscpp2xml \-\-help"

        created and/or updated in the source tree (unless given with full paths).
        The qm files are generated in the build tree.
        Updating the translations can be done by adding the qm_files
        to the source list of your library/executable, so they are
        always updated, or by adding a custom target to control when
        they get updated/generated.

function QT4_USE_MODULES( target [link_type] modules...)


.nf
        Make <target> use the <modules> from Qt. Using a Qt module means
        to link to the library, add the relevant include directories for the module,

        Modules are roughly equivalent to components of Qt4, so usage would be
        something like:
         qt4_use_modules(myexe Core Gui Declarative)
        to use QtCore, QtGui and QtDeclarative. The optional <link_type> argument can

  RUBY_INCLUDE_DIRS = include dirs to be used when using the ruby library
  RUBY_LIBRARY      = full path to the ruby library

.B FindSDL
Locate SDL library

This module defines

  SDL_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL
  SDL_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL.h
  SDL_VERSION_STRING, human\-readable string containing the version of SDL
.fi




This module responds to the the flag:


.nf
  SDL_BUILDING_LIBRARY
    If this is defined, then no SDL_main will be linked in because
    only applications need main().
    Otherwise, it is assumed you are building an application and this
    module will attempt to locate and set the the proper link flags
    as part of the returned SDL_LIBRARY variable.
.fi




Don't forget to include SDLmain.h and SDLmain.m your project for the OS X framework based version. (Other versions link to \-lSDLmain which this module will try to find on your behalf.) Also for OS X, this module will automatically add the \-framework Cocoa on your behalf.





Additional Note: If you see an empty SDL_LIBRARY_TEMP in your configuration and no SDL_LIBRARY, it means CMake did not find your SDL library (SDL.dll, libsdl.so, SDL.framework, etc). Set SDL_LIBRARY_TEMP to point to your SDL library, and configure again. Similarly, if you see an empty SDLMAIN_LIBRARY, you should set this value as appropriate. These values are used to generate the final SDL_LIBRARY variable, but when these values are unset, SDL_LIBRARY does not get created.





$SDLDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the ./configure \-\-prefix=$SDLDIR used in building SDL. l.e.galup  9\-20\-02


Modified by Eric Wing. Added code to assist with automated building by using environmental variables and providing a more controlled/consistent search behavior. Added new modifications to recognize OS X frameworks and additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc). Also corrected the header search path to follow "proper" SDL guidelines. Added a search for SDLmain which is needed by some platforms. Added a search for threads which is needed by some platforms. Added needed compile switches for MinGW.


On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others. People will have to manually change the cache values of SDL_LIBRARY to override this selection or set the CMake environment CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to modify the search paths.


Note that the header path has changed from SDL/SDL.h to just SDL.h This needed to change because "proper" SDL convention is #include "SDL.h", not <SDL/SDL.h>. This is done for portability reasons because not all systems place things in SDL/ (see FreeBSD).

.B FindSDL_sound
Locates the SDL_sound library




This module depends on SDL being found and must be called AFTER FindSDL.cmake is called.


This module defines


.nf
  SDL_SOUND_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL_sound.h
  SDL_SOUND_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL_sound
  SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES, this contains the list of libraries that you need
    to link against. This is a read\-only variable and is marked INTERNAL.
  SDL_SOUND_EXTRAS, this is an optional variable for you to add your own
    flags to SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES. This is prepended to SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES.
    This is available mostly for cases this module failed to anticipate for
    and you must add additional flags. This is marked as ADVANCED.
  SDL_SOUND_VERSION_STRING, human\-readable string containing the version of SDL_sound
.fi




This module also defines (but you shouldn't need to use directly)


.nf
   SDL_SOUND_LIBRARY, the name of just the SDL_sound library you would link
   against. Use SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES for you link instructions and not this one.
.fi

And might define the following as needed


.nf
   MIKMOD_LIBRARY
   MODPLUG_LIBRARY
   OGG_LIBRARY
   VORBIS_LIBRARY
   SMPEG_LIBRARY
   FLAC_LIBRARY
   SPEEX_LIBRARY
.fi




Typically, you should not use these variables directly, and you should use SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES which contains SDL_SOUND_LIBRARY and the other audio libraries (if needed) to successfully compile on your system.


Created by Eric Wing. This module is a bit more complicated than the other FindSDL* family modules. The reason is that SDL_sound can be compiled in a large variety of different ways which are independent of platform. SDL_sound may dynamically link against other 3rd party libraries to get additional codec support, such as Ogg Vorbis, SMPEG, ModPlug, MikMod, FLAC, Speex, and potentially others. Under some circumstances which I don't fully understand, there seems to be a requirement that dependent libraries of libraries you use must also be explicitly linked against in order to successfully compile. SDL_sound does not currently have any system in place to know how it was compiled. So this CMake module does the hard work in trying to discover which 3rd party libraries are required for building (if any). This module uses a brute force approach to create a test program that uses SDL_sound, and then tries to build it. If the build fails, it parses the error output for known symbol names to figure out which libraries are needed.


Responds to the $SDLDIR and $SDLSOUNDDIR environmental variable that would correspond to the ./configure \-\-prefix=$SDLDIR used in building SDL.


On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others. People will have to manually change the cache values of SDL_LIBRARY to override this selectionor set the CMake environment CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to modify the search paths.

  SDL_TTF_INCLUDE_DIRS, where to find the headers
  SDL_TTF_FOUND, if false, do not try to link against
  SDL_TTF_VERSION_STRING \- human\-readable string containing the version of SDL_ttf
.fi




For backward compatiblity the following variables are also set:


.nf
  SDLTTF_LIBRARY (same value as SDL_TTF_LIBRARIES)
  SDLTTF_INCLUDE_DIR (same value as SDL_TTF_INCLUDE_DIRS)
  SDLTTF_FOUND (same value as SDL_TTF_FOUND)
.fi

It provides the function squish_v4_add_test() for adding a squish test to cmake using Squish 4.x:


.nf
   squish_v4_add_test(cmakeTestName AUT targetName SUITE suiteName TEST squishTestName
                   [SETTINGSGROUP group] [PRE_COMMAND command] [POST_COMMAND command] )
.fi




The arguments have the following meaning:


.nf
   cmakeTestName: this will be used as the first argument for add_test()
   AUT targetName: the name of the cmake target which will be used as AUT, i.e. the
                   executable which will be tested.
   SUITE suiteName: this is either the full path to the squish suite, or just the
                    last directory of the suite, i.e. the suite name. In this case
                    the CMakeLists.txt which calls squish_add_test() must be located
                    in the parent directory of the suite directory.
   TEST squishTestName: the name of the squish test, i.e. the name of the subdirectory
                        of the test inside the suite directory.
   SETTINGSGROUP group: if specified, the given settings group will be used for executing the test.
                        If not specified, the groupname will be "CTest_<username>"
   PRE_COMMAND command:  if specified, the given command will be executed before starting the squish test.
   POST_COMMAND command: same as PRE_COMMAND, but after the squish test has been executed.
.fi




.nf
   enable_testing()
   find_package(Squish 4.0)
   if (SQUISH_FOUND)
      squish_v4_add_test(myTestName AUT myApp SUITE ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/tests/mySuite TEST someSquishTest SETTINGSGROUP myGroup )
   endif ()
.fi







For users of Squish version 3.x the macro squish_v3_add_test() is provided:


.nf
   squish_v3_add_test(testName applicationUnderTest testCase envVars testWrapper)
   Use this macro to add a test using Squish 3.x.

.B FindTCL
TK_INTERNAL_PATH was removed.

This module finds if Tcl is installed and determines where the include files and libraries are. It also determines what the name of the library is. This code sets the following variables:


.nf
  TCL_FOUND              = Tcl was found
  TK_FOUND               = Tk was found
  TCLTK_FOUND            = Tcl and Tk were found
  TCL_LIBRARY            = path to Tcl library (tcl tcl80)
  TCL_INCLUDE_PATH       = path to where tcl.h can be found
  TCL_TCLSH              = path to tclsh binary (tcl tcl80)
  TK_LIBRARY             = path to Tk library (tk tk80 etc)
  TK_INCLUDE_PATH        = path to where tk.h can be found
  TK_WISH                = full path to the wish executable
.fi




In an effort to remove some clutter and clear up some issues for people who are not necessarily Tcl/Tk gurus/developpers, some variables were moved or removed. Changes compared to CMake 2.4 are:


.nf
   => they were only useful for people writing Tcl/Tk extensions.
   => these libs are not packaged by default with Tcl/Tk distributions.
      Even when Tcl/Tk is built from source, several flavors of debug libs
      are created and there is no real reason to pick a single one
      specifically (say, amongst tcl84g, tcl84gs, or tcl84sgx).
      Let's leave that choice to the user by allowing him to assign
      TCL_LIBRARY to any Tcl library, debug or not.
   => this ended up being only a Win32 variable, and there is a lot of
      confusion regarding the location of this file in an installed Tcl/Tk
      tree anyway (see 8.5 for example). If you need the internal path at
      this point it is safer you ask directly where the *source* tree is
      and dig from there.

NOTE: It is highly recommended that you use the new FindOpenSceneGraph.cmake introduced in CMake 2.6.3 and not use this Find module directly.


This is part of the Findosg* suite used to find OpenSceneGraph components. Each component is separate and you must opt in to each module. You must also opt into OpenGL and OpenThreads (and Producer if needed) as these modules won't do it for you. This is to allow you control over your own system piece by piece in case you need to opt out of certain components or change the Find behavior for a particular module (perhaps because the default FindOpenGL.cmake module doesn't work with your system as an example). If you want to use a more convenient module that includes everything, use the FindOpenSceneGraph.cmake instead of the Findosg*.cmake modules.

OSG_FOUND \- Was the Osg found? OSG_INCLUDE_DIR \- Where to find the headers OSG_LIBRARIES \- The libraries to link against for the OSG (use this)

This is part of the Findosg* suite used to find OpenSceneGraph components. Each component is separate and you must opt in to each module. You must also opt into OpenGL and OpenThreads (and Producer if needed) as these modules won't do it for you. This is to allow you control over your own system piece by piece in case you need to opt out of certain components or change the Find behavior for a particular module (perhaps because the default FindOpenGL.cmake module doesn't work with your system as an example). If you want to use a more convenient module that includes everything, use the FindOpenSceneGraph.cmake instead of the Findosg*.cmake modules.

This CMake file contains two macros to assist with searching for OSG libraries and nodekits.  Please see FindOpenSceneGraph.cmake for full documentation.


.TP
.B FindwxWidgets
Find a wxWidgets (a.k.a., wxWindows) installation.

This module finds if wxWidgets is installed and selects a default configuration to use. wxWidgets is a modular library. To specify the modules that you will use, you need to name them as components to the package:


find_package(wxWidgets COMPONENTS core base ...)


There are two search branches: a windows style and a unix style. For windows, the following variables are searched for and set to defaults in case of multiple choices. Change them if the defaults are not desired (i.e., these are the only variables you should change to select a configuration):


.nf
  wxWidgets_ROOT_DIR      \- Base wxWidgets directory
                            (e.g., C:/wxWidgets\-2.6.3).
  wxWidgets_LIB_DIR       \- Path to wxWidgets libraries
                            (e.g., C:/wxWidgets\-2.6.3/lib/vc_lib).
  wxWidgets_CONFIGURATION \- Configuration to use
                            (e.g., msw, mswd, mswu, mswunivud, etc.)
  wxWidgets_EXCLUDE_COMMON_LIBRARIES
                          \- Set to TRUE to exclude linking of
                            commonly required libs (e.g., png tiff
                            jpeg zlib regex expat).
.fi




For unix style it uses the wx\-config utility. You can select between debug/release, unicode/ansi, universal/non\-universal, and static/shared in the QtDialog or ccmake interfaces by turning ON/OFF the following variables:


.nf
  wxWidgets_USE_DEBUG
  wxWidgets_USE_UNICODE
  wxWidgets_USE_UNIVERSAL
  wxWidgets_USE_STATIC
.fi




There is also a wxWidgets_CONFIG_OPTIONS variable for all other options that need to be passed to the wx\-config utility. For example, to use the base toolkit found in the /usr/local path, set the variable (before calling the FIND_PACKAGE command) as such:


.nf
  set(wxWidgets_CONFIG_OPTIONS \-\-toolkit=base \-\-prefix=/usr)
.fi




The following are set after the configuration is done for both windows and unix style:


.nf
  wxWidgets_FOUND            \- Set to TRUE if wxWidgets was found.
  wxWidgets_INCLUDE_DIRS     \- Include directories for WIN32
                               i.e., where to find "wx/wx.h" and
                               "wx/setup.h"; possibly empty for unices.
  wxWidgets_LIBRARIES        \- Path to the wxWidgets libraries.
  wxWidgets_LIBRARY_DIRS     \- compile time link dirs, useful for
                               rpath on UNIX. Typically an empty string
                               in WIN32 environment.
  wxWidgets_DEFINITIONS      \- Contains defines required to compile/link
                               against WX, e.g. WXUSINGDLL
  wxWidgets_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG\- Contains defines required to compile/link
                               against WX debug builds, e.g. __WXDEBUG__
  wxWidgets_CXX_FLAGS        \- Include dirs and compiler flags for
                               unices, empty on WIN32. Essentially
                               "`wx\-config \-\-cxxflags`".
  wxWidgets_USE_FILE         \- Convenience include file.
.fi




Sample usage:


.nf
   # Note that for MinGW users the order of libs is important!
   find_package(wxWidgets COMPONENTS net gl core base)
   if(wxWidgets_FOUND)
     include(${wxWidgets_USE_FILE})
     # and for each of your dependent executable/library targets:
     target_link_libraries(<YourTarget> ${wxWidgets_LIBRARIES})
   endif()
.fi




If wxWidgets is required (i.e., not an optional part):


.nf
   find_package(wxWidgets REQUIRED net gl core base)
   include(${wxWidgets_USE_FILE})
   # and for each of your dependent executable/library targets:
   target_link_libraries(<YourTarget> ${wxWidgets_LIBRARIES})
.fi

.TP
.B FindwxWindows
Find wxWindows (wxWidgets) installation

This module finds if wxWindows/wxWidgets is installed and determines where the include files and libraries are. It also determines what the name of the library is. Please note this file is DEPRECATED and replaced by FindwxWidgets.cmake. This code sets the following variables:


.nf
  WXWINDOWS_FOUND     = system has WxWindows
  WXWINDOWS_LIBRARIES = path to the wxWindows libraries
                        on Unix/Linux with additional
                        linker flags from
                        "wx\-config \-\-libs"
  CMAKE_WXWINDOWS_CXX_FLAGS  = Compiler flags for wxWindows,
                               essentially "`wx\-config \-\-cxxflags`"
                               on Linux
  WXWINDOWS_INCLUDE_DIR      = where to find "wx/wx.h" and "wx/setup.h"
  WXWINDOWS_LINK_DIRECTORIES = link directories, useful for rpath on
                                Unix
  WXWINDOWS_DEFINITIONS      = extra defines
.fi




OPTIONS If you need OpenGL support please


.nf
  set(WXWINDOWS_USE_GL 1)
.fi

in your CMakeLists.txt *before* you include this file.


.nf
  HAVE_ISYSTEM      \- true required to replace \-I by \-isystem on g++
.fi




For convenience include Use_wxWindows.cmake in your project's CMakeLists.txt using include(${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/Use_wxWindows.cmake).


USAGE


.nf
  set(WXWINDOWS_USE_GL 1)
  find_package(wxWindows)
.fi




NOTES wxWidgets 2.6.x is supported for monolithic builds e.g. compiled  in wx/build/msw dir as:


.nf
  nmake \-f makefile.vc BUILD=debug SHARED=0 USE_OPENGL=1 MONOLITHIC=1
.fi




DEPRECATED

.TP
.B FortranCInterface
Fortran/C Interface Detection

This module automatically detects the API by which C and Fortran languages interact.  Variables indicate if the mangling is found:


.nf
   FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_FOUND = Global subroutines and functions
   FortranCInterface_MODULE_FOUND = Module subroutines and functions
                                    (declared by "MODULE PROCEDURE")
.fi

A function is provided to generate a C header file containing macros to mangle symbol names:


.nf
   FortranCInterface_HEADER(<file>
                            [MACRO_NAMESPACE <macro\-ns>]
                            [SYMBOL_NAMESPACE <ns>]
                            [SYMBOLS [<module>:]<function> ...])
.fi

It generates in <file> definitions of the following macros:


.nf
   #define FortranCInterface_GLOBAL (name,NAME) ...
   #define FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_(name,NAME) ...
   #define FortranCInterface_MODULE (mod,name, MOD,NAME) ...
   #define FortranCInterface_MODULE_(mod,name, MOD,NAME) ...
.fi

These macros mangle four categories of Fortran symbols, respectively:


.nf
   \- Global symbols without '_': call mysub()
   \- Global symbols with '_'   : call my_sub()
   \- Module symbols without '_': use mymod; call mysub()
   \- Module symbols with '_'   : use mymod; call my_sub()
.fi

If mangling for a category is not known, its macro is left undefined. All macros require raw names in both lower case and upper case. The MACRO_NAMESPACE option replaces the default "FortranCInterface_" prefix with a given namespace "<macro\-ns>".


The SYMBOLS option lists symbols to mangle automatically with C preprocessor definitions:


.nf
   <function>          ==> #define <ns><function> ...
   <module>:<function> ==> #define <ns><module>_<function> ...
.fi

If the mangling for some symbol is not known then no preprocessor definition is created, and a warning is displayed. The SYMBOL_NAMESPACE option prefixes all preprocessor definitions generated by the SYMBOLS option with a given namespace "<ns>".


Example usage:


.nf
   include(FortranCInterface)
   FortranCInterface_HEADER(FC.h MACRO_NAMESPACE "FC_")
.fi

This creates a "FC.h" header that defines mangling macros FC_GLOBAL(), FC_GLOBAL_(), FC_MODULE(), and FC_MODULE_().


Example usage:


.nf
   include(FortranCInterface)
   FortranCInterface_HEADER(FCMangle.h
                            MACRO_NAMESPACE "FC_"
                            SYMBOL_NAMESPACE "FC_"
                            SYMBOLS mysub mymod:my_sub)
.fi

This creates a "FCMangle.h" header that defines the same FC_*() mangling macros as the previous example plus preprocessor symbols FC_mysub and FC_mymod_my_sub.


Another function is provided to verify that the Fortran and C/C++ compilers work together:


.nf
   FortranCInterface_VERIFY([CXX] [QUIET])
.fi

It tests whether a simple test executable using Fortran and C (and C++ when the CXX option is given) compiles and links successfully. The result is stored in the cache entry FortranCInterface_VERIFIED_C (or FortranCInterface_VERIFIED_CXX if CXX is given) as a boolean. If the check fails and QUIET is not given the function terminates with a FATAL_ERROR message describing the problem.  The purpose of this check is to stop a build early for incompatible compiler combinations.  The test is built in the Release configuration.


FortranCInterface is aware of possible GLOBAL and MODULE manglings for many Fortran compilers, but it also provides an interface to specify new possible manglings.  Set the variables


.nf
   FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_SYMBOLS
   FortranCInterface_MODULE_SYMBOLS
.fi

before including FortranCInterface to specify manglings of the symbols "MySub", "My_Sub", "MyModule:MySub", and "My_Module:My_Sub". For example, the code:


.nf
   set(FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_SYMBOLS mysub_ my_sub__ MYSUB_)
     #                                  ^^^^^  ^^^^^^   ^^^^^
   set(FortranCInterface_MODULE_SYMBOLS
       __mymodule_MOD_mysub __my_module_MOD_my_sub)
     #   ^^^^^^^^     ^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^     ^^^^^^
   include(FortranCInterface)
.fi

tells FortranCInterface to try given GLOBAL and MODULE manglings. (The carets point at raw symbol names for clarity in this example but are not needed.)

.TP
.B GNUInstallDirs
Define GNU standard installation directories

Provides install directory variables as defined for GNU software:


.nf
  http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Directory\-Variables.html
.fi

Inclusion of this module defines the following variables:


.nf
  CMAKE_INSTALL_<dir>      \- destination for files of a given type
  CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_<dir> \- corresponding absolute path
.fi

where <dir> is one of:


.nf
  BINDIR           \- user executables (bin)
  SBINDIR          \- system admin executables (sbin)
  LIBEXECDIR       \- program executables (libexec)
  SYSCONFDIR       \- read\-only single\-machine data (etc)
  SHAREDSTATEDIR   \- modifiable architecture\-independent data (com)
  LOCALSTATEDIR    \- modifiable single\-machine data (var)
  LIBDIR           \- object code libraries (lib or lib64 or lib/<multiarch\-tuple> on Debian)
  INCLUDEDIR       \- C header files (include)
  OLDINCLUDEDIR    \- C header files for non\-gcc (/usr/include)
  DATAROOTDIR      \- read\-only architecture\-independent data root (share)
  DATADIR          \- read\-only architecture\-independent data (DATAROOTDIR)
  INFODIR          \- info documentation (DATAROOTDIR/info)
  LOCALEDIR        \- locale\-dependent data (DATAROOTDIR/locale)
  MANDIR           \- man documentation (DATAROOTDIR/man)
  DOCDIR           \- documentation root (DATAROOTDIR/doc/PROJECT_NAME)
.fi

Each CMAKE_INSTALL_<dir> value may be passed to the DESTINATION options of install() commands for the corresponding file type.  If the includer does not define a value the above\-shown default will be used and the value will appear in the cache for editing by the user. Each CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_<dir> value contains an absolute path constructed from the corresponding destination by prepending (if necessary) the value of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.

.TP
.B GenerateExportHeader
Function for generation of export macros for libraries

This module provides the function GENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER() and the accompanying ADD_COMPILER_EXPORT_FLAGS() function.


The GENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER function can be used to generate a file suitable for preprocessor inclusion which contains EXPORT macros to be used in library classes.


GENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER( LIBRARY_TARGET


.nf
             [BASE_NAME <base_name>]
             [EXPORT_MACRO_NAME <export_macro_name>]
             [EXPORT_FILE_NAME <export_file_name>]
             [DEPRECATED_MACRO_NAME <deprecated_macro_name>]
             [NO_EXPORT_MACRO_NAME <no_export_macro_name>]
             [STATIC_DEFINE <static_define>]
             [NO_DEPRECATED_MACRO_NAME <no_deprecated_macro_name>]
             [DEFINE_NO_DEPRECATED]
             [PREFIX_NAME <prefix_name>]
.fi

)


ADD_COMPILER_EXPORT_FLAGS( [<output_variable>] )


By default GENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER() generates macro names in a file name determined by the name of the library. The ADD_COMPILER_EXPORT_FLAGS function adds \-fvisibility=hidden to CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS if supported, and is a no\-op on Windows which does not need extra compiler flags for exporting support. You may optionally pass a single argument to ADD_COMPILER_EXPORT_FLAGS that will be populated with the required CXX_FLAGS required to enable visibility support for the compiler/architecture in use.


This means that in the simplest case, users of these functions will be equivalent to:


.nf
   add_compiler_export_flags()
   add_library(somelib someclass.cpp)
   generate_export_header(somelib)
   install(TARGETS somelib DESTINATION ${LIBRARY_INSTALL_DIR})
   install(FILES
    someclass.h
    ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/somelib_export.h DESTINATION ${INCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR}
   )
.fi




And in the ABI header files:


.nf
   #include "somelib_export.h"
   class SOMELIB_EXPORT SomeClass {
     ...
   };
.fi




The CMake fragment will generate a file in the ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR} called somelib_export.h containing the macros SOMELIB_EXPORT, SOMELIB_NO_EXPORT, SOMELIB_DEPRECATED, SOMELIB_DEPRECATED_EXPORT and SOMELIB_DEPRECATED_NO_EXPORT. The resulting file should be installed with other headers in the library.


The BASE_NAME argument can be used to override the file name and the names used for the macros


.nf
   add_library(somelib someclass.cpp)
   generate_export_header(somelib
     BASE_NAME other_name
   )
.fi




Generates a file called other_name_export.h containing the macros OTHER_NAME_EXPORT, OTHER_NAME_NO_EXPORT and OTHER_NAME_DEPRECATED etc.


The BASE_NAME may be overridden by specifiying other options in the function. For example:


.nf
   add_library(somelib someclass.cpp)
   generate_export_header(somelib
     EXPORT_MACRO_NAME OTHER_NAME_EXPORT
   )
.fi




creates the macro OTHER_NAME_EXPORT instead of SOMELIB_EXPORT, but other macros and the generated file name is as default.


.nf
   add_library(somelib someclass.cpp)
   generate_export_header(somelib
     DEPRECATED_MACRO_NAME KDE_DEPRECATED
   )
.fi




creates the macro KDE_DEPRECATED instead of SOMELIB_DEPRECATED.


If LIBRARY_TARGET is a static library, macros are defined without values.


If the same sources are used to create both a shared and a static library, the uppercased symbol ${BASE_NAME}_STATIC_DEFINE should be used when building the static library


.nf
   add_library(shared_variant SHARED ${lib_SRCS})
   add_library(static_variant ${lib_SRCS})
   generate_export_header(shared_variant BASE_NAME libshared_and_static)
   set_target_properties(static_variant PROPERTIES
     COMPILE_FLAGS \-DLIBSHARED_AND_STATIC_STATIC_DEFINE)

This will cause the export macros to expand to nothing when building the static library.


If DEFINE_NO_DEPRECATED is specified, then a macro ${BASE_NAME}_NO_DEPRECATED will be defined This macro can be used to remove deprecated code from preprocessor output.


.nf
   option(EXCLUDE_DEPRECATED "Exclude deprecated parts of the library" FALSE)
   if (EXCLUDE_DEPRECATED)
     set(NO_BUILD_DEPRECATED DEFINE_NO_DEPRECATED)
   endif()
   generate_export_header(somelib ${NO_BUILD_DEPRECATED})
.fi




And then in somelib:


.nf
   class SOMELIB_EXPORT SomeClass
   {
   public:
   #ifndef SOMELIB_NO_DEPRECATED
     SOMELIB_DEPRECATED void oldMethod();
   #endif
   };
.fi




.nf
   #ifndef SOMELIB_NO_DEPRECATED
   void SomeClass::oldMethod() {  }
   #endif
.fi




If PREFIX_NAME is specified, the argument will be used as a prefix to all generated macros.


For example:


.nf
   generate_export_header(somelib PREFIX_NAME VTK_)
.fi




Generates the macros VTK_SOMELIB_EXPORT etc.

.TP
.B GetPrerequisites
Functions to analyze and list executable file prerequisites.

This module provides functions to list the .dll, .dylib or .so files that an executable or shared library file depends on. (Its prerequisites.)


It uses various tools to obtain the list of required shared library files:


.nf
   dumpbin (Windows)
   objdump (MinGW on Windows)
   ldd (Linux/Unix)
   otool (Mac OSX)
.fi

The following functions are provided by this module:


.nf
   get_prerequisites
   list_prerequisites
   list_prerequisites_by_glob
   gp_append_unique
   is_file_executable
   gp_item_default_embedded_path
     (projects can override with gp_item_default_embedded_path_override)
   gp_resolve_item
     (projects can override with gp_resolve_item_override)
   gp_resolved_file_type
     (projects can override with gp_resolved_file_type_override)
   gp_file_type
.fi

Requires CMake 2.6 or greater because it uses function, break, return and PARENT_SCOPE.


.nf
  GET_PREREQUISITES(<target> <prerequisites_var> <exclude_system> <recurse>
                    <exepath> <dirs>)
.fi

Get the list of shared library files required by <target>. The list in the variable named <prerequisites_var> should be empty on first entry to this function. On exit, <prerequisites_var> will contain the list of required shared library files.


<target> is the full path to an executable file. <prerequisites_var> is the name of a CMake variable to contain the results. <exclude_system> must be 0 or 1 indicating whether to include or exclude "system" prerequisites. If <recurse> is set to 1 all prerequisites will be found recursively, if set to 0 only direct prerequisites are listed. <exepath> is the path to the top level executable used for @executable_path replacment on the Mac. <dirs> is a list of paths where libraries might be found: these paths are searched first when a target without any path info is given. Then standard system locations are also searched: PATH, Framework locations, /usr/lib...


.nf
  LIST_PREREQUISITES(<target> [<recurse> [<exclude_system> [<verbose>]]])
.fi

Print a message listing the prerequisites of <target>.


<target> is the name of a shared library or executable target or the full path to a shared library or executable file. If <recurse> is set to 1 all prerequisites will be found recursively, if set to 0 only direct prerequisites are listed. <exclude_system> must be 0 or 1 indicating whether to include or exclude "system" prerequisites. With <verbose> set to 0 only the full path names of the prerequisites are printed, set to 1 extra informatin will be displayed.


.nf
  LIST_PREREQUISITES_BY_GLOB(<glob_arg> <glob_exp>)
.fi

Print the prerequisites of shared library and executable files matching a globbing pattern. <glob_arg> is GLOB or GLOB_RECURSE and <glob_exp> is a globbing expression used with "file(GLOB" or "file(GLOB_RECURSE" to retrieve a list of matching files. If a matching file is executable, its prerequisites are listed.


Any additional (optional) arguments provided are passed along as the optional arguments to the list_prerequisites calls.


.nf
  GP_APPEND_UNIQUE(<list_var> <value>)
.fi

Append <value> to the list variable <list_var> only if the value is not already in the list.


.nf
  IS_FILE_EXECUTABLE(<file> <result_var>)
.fi

Return 1 in <result_var> if <file> is a binary executable, 0 otherwise.


.nf
  GP_ITEM_DEFAULT_EMBEDDED_PATH(<item> <default_embedded_path_var>)
.fi

Return the path that others should refer to the item by when the item is embedded inside a bundle.


Override on a per\-project basis by providing a project\-specific gp_item_default_embedded_path_override function.


.nf
  GP_RESOLVE_ITEM(<context> <item> <exepath> <dirs> <resolved_item_var>)
.fi

Resolve an item into an existing full path file.


Override on a per\-project basis by providing a project\-specific gp_resolve_item_override function.


.nf
  GP_RESOLVED_FILE_TYPE(<original_file> <file> <exepath> <dirs> <type_var>)
.fi

Return the type of <file> with respect to <original_file>. String describing type of prerequisite is returned in variable named <type_var>.


Use <exepath> and <dirs> if necessary to resolve non\-absolute <file> values \-\- but only for non\-embedded items.


Possible types are:


.nf
   system
   local
   embedded
   other
.fi

Override on a per\-project basis by providing a project\-specific gp_resolved_file_type_override function.


.nf
  GP_FILE_TYPE(<original_file> <file> <type_var>)
.fi

Return the type of <file> with respect to <original_file>. String describing type of prerequisite is returned in variable named <type_var>.


Possible types are:


.nf
   system
   local
   embedded
   other
.fi

.TP
.B InstallRequiredSystemLibraries
.nf
 
.fi

By including this file, all library files listed in the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS will be installed with install(PROGRAMS ...) into bin for WIN32 and lib for non\-WIN32. If CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS_SKIP is set to TRUE before including this file, then the INSTALL command is not called. The user can use the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS to use a custom install command and install them however they want. If it is the MSVC compiler, then the microsoft run time libraries will be found and automatically added to the CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS, and installed. If CMAKE_INSTALL_DEBUG_LIBRARIES is set and it is the MSVC compiler, then the debug libraries are installed when available. If CMAKE_INSTALL_DEBUG_LIBRARIES_ONLY is set then only the debug libraries are installed when both debug and release are available. If CMAKE_INSTALL_MFC_LIBRARIES is set then the MFC run time libraries are installed as well as the CRT run time libraries. If CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_DESTINATION is set then the libraries are installed to that directory rather than the default. If CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS_NO_WARNINGS is NOT set, then this file warns about required files that do not exist. You can set this variable to ON before including this file to avoid the warning. For example, the Visual Studio Express editions do not include the redistributable files, so if you include this file on a machine with only VS Express installed, you'll get the warning.

.TP
.B MacroAddFileDependencies
MACRO_ADD_FILE_DEPENDENCIES(<_file> depend_files...)

Using the macro MACRO_ADD_FILE_DEPENDENCIES() is discouraged. There are usually better ways to specify the correct dependencies.


MACRO_ADD_FILE_DEPENDENCIES(<_file> depend_files...) is just a convenience wrapper around the OBJECT_DEPENDS source file property. You can just use set_property(SOURCE <file> APPEND PROPERTY OBJECT_DEPENDS depend_files) instead.

.TP
.B ProcessorCount
ProcessorCount(var)

Determine the number of processors/cores and save value in ${var}


Sets the variable named ${var} to the number of physical cores available on the machine if the information can be determined. Otherwise it is set to 0. Currently this functionality is implemented for AIX, cygwin, FreeBSD, HPUX, IRIX, Linux, Mac OS X, QNX, Sun and Windows.


This function is guaranteed to return a positive integer (>=1) if it succeeds. It returns 0 if there's a problem determining the processor count.


Example use, in a ctest \-S dashboard script:


.nf
   include(ProcessorCount)
   ProcessorCount(N)
   if(NOT N EQUAL 0)
     set(CTEST_BUILD_FLAGS \-j${N})
     set(ctest_test_args ${ctest_test_args} PARALLEL_LEVEL ${N})
   endif()
.fi




This function is intended to offer an approximation of the value of the number of compute cores available on the current machine, such that you may use that value for parallel building and parallel testing. It is meant to help utilize as much of the machine as seems reasonable. Of course, knowledge of what else might be running on the machine simultaneously should be used when deciding whether to request a machine's full capacity all for yourself.

select_library_configurations( basename )


This macro takes a library base name as an argument, and will choose good values for basename_LIBRARY, basename_LIBRARIES, basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG, and basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE depending on what has been found and set.  If only basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE is defined, basename_LIBRARY, basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG, and basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE will be set to the release value.  If only basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG is defined, then basename_LIBRARY, basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG and basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE will take the debug value.


If the generator supports configuration types, then basename_LIBRARY and basename_LIBRARIES will be set with debug and optimized flags specifying the library to be used for the given configuration.  If no build type has been set or the generator in use does not support configuration types, then basename_LIBRARY and basename_LIBRARIES will take only the release values.

.B UseJava
Use Module for Java

This file provides functions for Java. It is assumed that FindJava.cmake has already been loaded.  See FindJava.cmake for information on how to load Java into your CMake project.


add_jar(target_name


.nf
         [SOURCES] source1 [source2 ...] [resource1 ...]
         [INCLUDE_JARS jar1 [jar2 ...]]
        )
.fi




This command creates a <target_name>.jar. It compiles the given source files (source) and adds the given resource files (resource) to the jar file. If only resource files are given then just a jar file is created. The list of include jars are added to the classpath when compiling the java sources and also to the dependencies of the target. INCLUDE_JARS also accepts other target names created by add_jar. For backwards compatibility, jar files listed as sources are ignored (as they have been since the first version of this module).


Additional instructions:


.nf
   To add compile flags to the target you can set these flags with
   the following variable:
.fi




.nf
       set(CMAKE_JAVA_COMPILE_FLAGS \-nowarn)
.fi




.nf
   To add a path or a jar file to the class path you can do this
   with the CMAKE_JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH variable.
.fi




.nf
       set(CMAKE_JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH /usr/share/java/shibboleet.jar)
.fi




.nf
   To use a different output name for the target you can set it with:
.fi




.nf
       set(CMAKE_JAVA_TARGET_OUTPUT_NAME shibboleet.jar)
       add_jar(foobar foobar.java)
.fi




.nf
   To use a different output directory than CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR
   you can set it with:
.fi




.nf
       set(CMAKE_JAVA_TARGET_OUTPUT_DIR ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/bin)
.fi




.nf
   To define an entry point in your jar you can set it with:
.fi




.nf
       set(CMAKE_JAVA_JAR_ENTRY_POINT com/examples/MyProject/Main)
.fi




.nf
   To add a VERSION to the target output name you can set it using
   CMAKE_JAVA_TARGET_VERSION. This will create a jar file with the name
   shibboleet\-1.0.0.jar and will create a symlink shibboleet.jar
   pointing to the jar with the version information.
.fi




.nf
       set(CMAKE_JAVA_TARGET_VERSION 1.2.0)
       add_jar(shibboleet shibbotleet.java)
.fi




.nf
    If the target is a JNI library, utilize the following commands to
    create a JNI symbolic link:
.fi




.nf
       set(CMAKE_JNI_TARGET TRUE)
       set(CMAKE_JAVA_TARGET_VERSION 1.2.0)
       add_jar(shibboleet shibbotleet.java)
       install_jar(shibboleet ${LIB_INSTALL_DIR}/shibboleet)
       install_jni_symlink(shibboleet ${JAVA_LIB_INSTALL_DIR})
.fi




.nf
    If a single target needs to produce more than one jar from its
    java source code, to prevent the accumulation of duplicate class
    files in subsequent jars, set/reset CMAKE_JAR_CLASSES_PREFIX prior
    to calling the add_jar() function:
.fi




.nf
       set(CMAKE_JAR_CLASSES_PREFIX com/redhat/foo)
       add_jar(foo foo.java)
.fi




.nf
       set(CMAKE_JAR_CLASSES_PREFIX com/redhat/bar)
       add_jar(bar bar.java)
.fi




Target Properties:


.nf
   The add_jar() functions sets some target properties. You can get these
   properties with the
      get_property(TARGET <target_name> PROPERTY <propery_name>)
   command.
.fi




.nf
   INSTALL_FILES      The files which should be installed. This is used by
                      install_jar().
   JNI_SYMLINK        The JNI symlink which should be installed.
                      This is used by install_jni_symlink().
   JAR_FILE           The location of the jar file so that you can include
                      it.
   CLASS_DIR          The directory where the class files can be found. For
                      example to use them with javah.

          [VERSIONS version1 [version2]]
          [DOC "cache documentation string"]
         )
.fi




This command is used to find a full path to the named jar. A cache entry named by <VAR> is created to stor the result of this command. If the full path to a jar is found the result is stored in the variable and the search will not repeated unless the variable is cleared. If nothing is found, the result will be <VAR>\-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again next time find_jar is invoked with the same variable. The name of the full path to a file that is searched for is specified by the names listed after NAMES argument. Additional search locations can be specified after the PATHS argument. If you require special a version of a jar file you can specify it with the VERSIONS argument. The argument after DOC will be used for the documentation string in the cache.


install_jar(TARGET_NAME DESTINATION)


This command installs the TARGET_NAME files to the given DESTINATION. It should be called in the same scope as add_jar() or it will fail.


install_jni_symlink(TARGET_NAME DESTINATION)


This command installs the TARGET_NAME JNI symlinks to the given DESTINATION. It should be called in the same scope as add_jar() or it will fail.

Create java documentation based on files or packages. For more details please read the javadoc manpage.


There are two main signatures for create_javadoc. The first signature works with package names on a path with source files:


.nf
   Example:
   create_javadoc(my_example_doc
     PACKAGES com.exmaple.foo com.example.bar
     SOURCEPATH "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}"
     CLASSPATH ${CMAKE_JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH}
     WINDOWTITLE "My example"
     DOCTITLE "<h1>My example</h1>"
     AUTHOR TRUE
     USE TRUE
     VERSION TRUE
   )
.fi




The second signature for create_javadoc works on a given list of files.


.nf
   create_javadoc(<VAR>
                  FILES file1 [file2 ...]
                  [CLASSPATH <classpath>]
                  [INSTALLPATH <install path>]
                  [DOCTITLE "the documentation title"]
                  [WINDOWTITLE "the title of the document"]
                  [AUTHOR TRUE|FALSE]
                  [USE TRUE|FALSE]
                  [VERSION TRUE|FALSE]
                 )
.fi




Example:


.nf
   create_javadoc(my_example_doc
     FILES ${example_SRCS}
     CLASSPATH ${CMAKE_JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH}
     WINDOWTITLE "My example"
     DOCTITLE "<h1>My example</h1>"
     AUTHOR TRUE
     USE TRUE
     VERSION TRUE
   )
.fi




Both signatures share most of the options. These options are the same as what you can find in the javadoc manpage. Please look at the manpage for CLASSPATH, DOCTITLE, WINDOWTITLE, AUTHOR, USE and VERSION.


The documentation will be by default installed to


.nf
   ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/share/javadoc/<VAR>
.fi




if you don't set the INSTALLPATH.

     \- Link libraries to swig module
.fi

All other macros are for internal use only. To get the actual name of the swig module, use: ${SWIG_MODULE_${name}_REAL_NAME}. Set Source files properties such as CPLUSPLUS and SWIG_FLAGS to specify special behavior of SWIG. Also global CMAKE_SWIG_FLAGS can be used to add special flags to all swig calls. Another special variable is CMAKE_SWIG_OUTDIR, it allows one to specify where to write all the swig generated module (swig \-outdir option) The name\-specific variable SWIG_MODULE_<name>_EXTRA_DEPS may be used to specify extra dependencies for the generated modules. If the source file generated by swig need some special flag you can use set_source_files_properties( ${swig_generated_file_fullname}
